              "'Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as Eminem (also stylized as EMINƎM), is an American rapper. He is credited with popularizing hip hop in Middle America and is regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time. His global success is considered to have broken racial barriers to the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him a controversial figure, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as influencing many musical artists. His most popular songs include \"My Name Is\", \"The Real Slim Shady\", \"Stan\", \"Without Me\", \"Lose Yourself\", \"Not Afraid\", \"Love the Way You Lie\", \"The Monster\" and \"Houdini\".\\nAfter the release of his debut album Infinite (1996) and the extended play Slim Shady EP (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dre\\'s Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP. His next two releases, The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and The Eminem Show (2002), were worldwide successes and were nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, the latter becoming the best-selling album worldwide of 2002. After the release of his next album, Encore (2004), Eminem went on hiatus, largely due to a prescription drug addiction. He returned to the music industry with the releases of Relapse (2009) and Recovery (2010), the latter becoming the best-selling album worldwide of 2010. He then released the US number-one albums The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013), Revival (2017), Kamikaze (2018), and Music to Be Murdered By (2020). His twelfth studio album, The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce), was released in July 2024.\\nEminem was also a member of the hip hop group D12, and has collaborated with fellow Detroit-based rapper Royce da 5\\'9\" as the duo Bad Meets Evil. Eminem played a dramatized version of himself in the 2002 musical drama film 8 Mile. \"Lose Yourself\", a song from its soundtrack, topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 12 weeks—the most for a solo rap song—and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, making him the first hip hop artist ever to win the award. He also co-founded Shady Records, which helped launch the careers of artists such as D12, 50 Cent, and Obie Trice, and established his own Sirius XM Radio channel, Shade 45.\\nEminem is among the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated worldwide sales of over 220 million records. He was the best-selling music artist in the United States for the 2000s, placing third for the 2010s. He was the first artist to have ten albums consecutively debut at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, and has had five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Curtain Call: The Hits (2005), \"Lose Yourself\", \"Love the Way You Lie\", and \"Not Afraid\" have all been certified Diamond or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). He has won numerous awards, including 15 Grammy Awards, eight American Music Awards, 17 Billboard Music Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, and an MTV Europe Music Global Icon Award. Billboard named him the \"Artist of the Decade (2000–2009)\", and Rolling Stone named him one of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\" and \"100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time\". In 2022, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\\n\\nEarly life\\nMarshall Bruce Mathers III was born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri, the only child of Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr. and Deborah Rae \"Debbie\" (née Nelson). His mother nearly died during her 73-hour labor with him. Eminem\\'s parents were in a band called Daddy Warbucks, playing in Ramada Inns along the Dakotas–Montana border before they separated. His father abandoned his family when Eminem was a year and a half old, and Eminem was raised only by his mother, Debbie, in poverty. He wrote letters to his father, but Debbie said that they all came back marked \"return to sender\". His mother later had a son named Nathan \"Nate\" Kane Samara. \\nBy age of twelve, Eminem and his mother shuttled between states, rarely staying in one house for more than a year or two and mostly living with family members, moved several times and lived in several towns and cities in Missouri (including St. Joseph, Savannah, and Kansas City) and Metro Detroit (Warren and Roseville) before settling in the city of Detroit. For much of his youth, Eminem and his mother lived in a working-class, primarily black, Detroit neighborhood. He and Debbie were one of three white households on their block, and Eminem was beaten several times by black youths.\\nEminem frequently fought with his mother, whom a social worker described as her having a \"very suspicious, almost paranoid personality\". When he was a child, a bully named D\\'Angelo Bailey severely injured Eminem\\'s head in an assault, an incident which Eminem later recounted (with comic exaggeration) on the song \"Brain Damage\". Debbie filed a lawsuit against the public school for this in 1982. The suit was dismissed the following year by a Macomb County, Michigan, judge, who said the schools were immune from lawsuits.\\nEminem was interested in storytelling, aspiring to be a comic book artist before discovering hip hop. He heard his first rap song (\"Reckless\", featuring Ice-T) on the Breakin\\' soundtrack, a gift from Debbie\\'s half-brother, Ronnie Polkingharn. His uncle was close to the boy and later became a musical mentor to him. When Polkingharn committed suicide in 1991, Eminem stopped speaking publicly for days and did not attend his funeral.\\nAt age 14, Eminem began rapping with high-school friend Mike Ruby; they adopted the names \"Manix\" and \"M&M\", the latter evolving into \"Eminem\". Eminem snuck into neighboring Osborn High School with friend and fellow rapper Proof for lunchroom freestyle rap battles. On Saturdays, they attended open mic contests at the Hip-Hop Shop on West 7 Mile Road, considered \"ground zero\" for the Detroit rap scene. Struggling to succeed in a predominantly black industry, Eminem was appreciated by underground hip hop audiences. When he wrote verses, he wanted most of the words to rhyme; he wrote long words or phrases on paper and, underneath, worked on rhymes for each syllable. Although the words often made little sense, the drill helped Eminem practice sounds and rhymes.\\nIn 1987, Debbie allowed runaway Kimberly Anne \"Kim\" Scott to stay at their home. Several years later, Eminem began an on-and-off relationship with Scott. After spending three years in ninth grade due to truancy and poor grades, he dropped out of Lincoln High School at age 17. Although interested in English, Eminem never explored literature (preferring comic books) and he disliked math and social studies. Eminem worked at several jobs to help his mother pay the bills. One of the jobs he had was with Little Caesar\\'s Pizza in Warren. He later said she often threw him out of the house anyway, often after taking most of his paycheck. When she left to play bingo, he would blast the stereo and write songs.\\n\\nMusic career\\n1988–1997: early career, Infinite and family struggles\\nIn 1988, he went by the stage name MC Double M and formed his first group, New Jacks, and made a self-titled demo tape with DJ Butter Fingers. In 1989, they later joined Bassmint Productions who later changed their name to Soul Intent in 1992 with rapper Proof and other childhood friends. They released a self-titled EP in 1995 featuring Proof. Eminem also made his first music video appearance in 1992 in a song titled, \"Do-Da-Dippity\", by Champtown. Later in 1996, Eminem and Proof teamed up with four other rappers to form The Dirty Dozen (D12), who released The Underground E.P. in 1997 and their first album Devil\\'s Night in 2001. He was also affiliated with Newark\\'s rap collective Outsidaz, collaborating with them on different projects.\\nEminem was soon signed to Jeff and Mark Bass\\'s F.B.T. Productions and recorded his debut album Infinite for their independent Web Entertainment label. The album was a commercial failure upon its release in 1996. One lyrical subject of Infinite was his struggle to raise his newborn daughter, Hailie Jade Scott Mathers, on little money. During this period, Eminem\\'s rhyming style, primarily inspired by rappers Nas, Esham and AZ, lacked the comically violent slant for which he later became known. Detroit disc jockeys largely ignored Infinite and the feedback Eminem did receive (\"Why don\\'t you go into rock and roll?\") led him to craft angrier, moodier tracks.\\nAt this time Eminem and Kim Scott lived in a crime-ridden neighborhood and their house was robbed several times. Eminem cooked and washed dishes for minimum wage at Gilbert\\'s Lodge, a family-style restaurant at St. Clair Shores. His former boss described him as becoming a model employee, as he worked 60 hours a week for six months after Hailie\\'s birth. He was fired shortly before Christmas and later said, \"It was, like, five days before Christmas, which is Hailie\\'s birthday. I had, like, forty dollars to get her something.\" After the release of Infinite, his personal problems and substance abuse culminated in a suicide attempt. By March 1997 he was fired from Gilbert\\'s Lodge for the last time and lived in his mother\\'s mobile home with Kim and Hailie.\\n\\n1997–1999: introduction of Slim Shady, The Slim Shady LP and rise to success\\nEminem attracted more attention when he developed Slim Shady, a sadistic, violent alter ego. The character allowed him to express his anger with lyrics about drugs, rape and murder. In the spring of 1997 he recorded his debut EP, the Slim Shady EP, which was released that winter by Web Entertainment. The EP, with frequent references to drug use, sexual acts, mental instability and violence, also explored the more-serious themes of dealing with poverty and marital and family difficulties and revealed his direct, self-deprecating response to criticism. Hip hop magazine The Source featured Eminem in its \"Unsigned Hype\" column in March 1998.\\nAfter he was fired from his job and evicted from his home, Eminem went to Los Angeles to compete in the 1997 Rap Olympics, a nationwide battle rap competition. He placed second, losing to Project Blowed MC Otherwize. An Interscope Records intern named Dean Geistlinger was in attendance and asked Eminem for a copy of the Slim Shady EP, which was then sent to company CEO Jimmy Iovine. Iovine played the tape for record producer Dr. Dre, founder of Aftermath Entertainment and founding member of hip hop group N.W.A. Dre recalled, \"In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, \\'Find him. Now.\\'\" Dre would later state on the fourth and last episode of The Defiant Ones, \"I was like: what the fuck!?, and who the fuck is that?\" expressing his shock towards Mathers\\'s rapping talent. Although his associates criticized him for hiring a white rapper, Dre was confident in his decision: \"I don\\'t give a fuck if you\\'re purple; if you can kick it, I\\'m working with you.\" Eminem had idolized Dre since listening to N.W.A as a teenager and was nervous about working with him on an album: \"I didn\\'t want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much ... I\\'m just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars let alone Dr. Dre.\" He became more comfortable working with Dre after a series of productive recording sessions.\\nEminem released The Slim Shady LP in February 1999. Although it was one of the year\\'s most popular albums (certified triple platinum by the end of the year), he was accused of imitating the style and subject matter of underground rapper Cage. The album\\'s popularity was accompanied by controversy over its lyrics; in \"\\'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" Eminem describes a trip with his infant daughter when he disposes of his wife\\'s body and in \"Guilty Conscience\" which encourages a man to murder his wife and her lover. \"Guilty Conscience\" marked the beginning of a friendship and musical bond between Dr. Dre and Eminem. The label-mates later collaborated on a number of hit songs (\"Forgot About Dre\" and \"What\\'s the Difference\" while also providing uncredited vocals on \"The Watcher\" from Dr. Dre\\'s album 2001, \"Bitch Please II\" from The Marshall Mathers LP, \"Say What You Say\" from The Eminem Show, \"Encore/Curtains Down\" from Encore and \"Old Time\\'s Sake\" and \"Crack a Bottle\" from Relapse) and Dre made at least one guest appearance on each of Eminem\\'s Aftermath albums. The Slim Shady LP has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA.\\n\\n1999–2003: The Marshall Mathers LP and The Eminem Show\\nAfter Eminem released The Slim Shady LP, he started his own record label, Shady Records, in late 1999. Eminem looked for an avenue to release D12, and his manager Paul Rosenberg was keen to start a label, which led to the two teaming up to form Shady. Its A&R Marc Labelle has defined the record label as \"a boutique label but [with] all the outlets of a major [and] Interscope backing up our every move.\"\\nRecorded from 1999 to 2000, The Marshall Mathers LP was released in May 2000. It sold 1.76 million copies in its first week, breaking US records held by Snoop Dogg\\'s Doggystyle for fastest-selling hip hop album and Britney Spears\\' ...Baby One More Time for fastest-selling solo album. The first single from the album, \"The Real Slim Shady\", was a success despite controversies about Eminem\\'s insults and dubious claims about celebrities (for example, that Christina Aguilera had performed oral sex on Carson Daly and Fred Durst). In his second single, \"The Way I Am\", he reveals the pressure from his record company to top \"My Name Is\". Although Eminem parodied shock rocker Marilyn Manson in the music video for \"My Name Is\", they are reportedly on good terms; Manson is mentioned in \"The Way I Am\", appeared in its music video and has performed a live remix of the song with Eminem. In the third single, \"Stan\" (which samples Dido\\'s \"Thank You\"), Eminem tries to deal with his new fame, assuming the persona of a deranged fan who kills himself and his pregnant girlfriend (mirroring \"\\'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" from The Slim Shady LP).\\nThe music magazine Q called \"Stan\" the third-greatest rap song ever, and it was ranked tenth in a Top40-Charts.com survey. The song has since been ranked 296th on Rolling Stone\\'s \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list. In July 2000, Eminem was the first white artist to appear on the cover of The Source. The Marshall Mathers LP was certified Diamond by the RIAA in March 2011 and sold 21 million copies worldwide.\\nIn 2000 Eminem also appeared in the Up in Smoke Tour with rappers Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit and Ice Cube and the Family Values Tour with Limp Bizkit, headlining the Anger Management Tour with Papa Roach, Ludacris and Xzibit. Eminem performed with Elton John at the 43rd Grammy Awards ceremony in 2001, with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD, an organization which considered Eminem\\'s lyrics homophobic) condemning John\\'s decision to perform with Eminem. Entertainment Weekly placed the appearance on its end-of-decade \"best-of\" list: \"It was the hug heard \\'round the world. Eminem, under fire for homophobic lyrics, shared the stage with a gay icon for a performance of \\'Stan\\' that would have been memorable in any context.\" On February 21, the day of the awards ceremony, GLAAD held a protest outside the Staples Center (the ceremony\\'s venue). Eminem was also the only guest artist to appear on fellow rapper Jay-Z\\'s critically acclaimed album The Blueprint, producing and rapping on the song \"Renegade\".\\nThe Eminem Show was released in May 2002. It was another success, reaching number one on the charts and selling over 1.332 million copies during its first full week. The album\\'s single, \"Without Me\", denigrates boy bands, Limp Bizkit, Dick and Lynne Cheney, Moby and others. The Eminem Show, certified Diamond by the RIAA, examines the effects of Eminem\\'s rise to fame, his relationship with his wife and daughter and his status in the hip hop community, addressing an assault charge brought by a bouncer he saw kissing his wife in 2000. Although several tracks are clearly angry, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found The Eminem Show less inflammatory than The Marshall Mathers LP. L. Brent Bozell III, who had criticized The Marshall Mathers LP for misogynistic lyrics, noted The Eminem Show\\'s extensive use of obscenity and called Eminem \"Eminef\" for the prevalence of the word \"motherfucker\" on the album. The Eminem Show sold 27 million copies worldwide and was the bestselling album of 2002.\\n\\n2003–2007: production work, Encore and musical hiatus\\nIn 2003, Eminem, a lifelong fan of Tupac, provided production work for three tracks on the Tupac Resurrection soundtrack. He would follow this up the next year by producing 12 of the 16 tracks on Tupac\\'s Loyal to the Game album. On December 8, 2003, the United States Secret Service said that it was \"looking into\" allegations that Eminem had threatened the President of the United States. The cause for concern was the lyrics of \"We As Americans\" (\"Fuck money / I don\\'t rap for dead presidents / I\\'d rather see the president dead / It\\'s never been said, but I set precedents\"), which was later released on a bonus CD with the deluxe edition of Encore.\\nEncore, released in 2004, was another success, but not as successful as his previous albums. Its sales were partially driven by the first single, \"Just Lose It\", which contained slurs directed toward Michael Jackson. On October 12, 2004, a week after the release of \"Just Lose It\", Jackson phoned Steve Harvey\\'s radio show, The Steve Harvey Morning Show, to report his displeasure with its video (which parodies Jackson\\'s child molestation trial, plastic surgery and the 1984 incident when Jackson\\'s hair caught fire during the filming of a commercial). In the song, Eminem says, \"That\\'s not a stab at Michael / That\\'s just a metaphor / I\\'m just psycho.\" Many of Jackson\\'s friends and supporters spoke out against the video, including Stevie Wonder, who described it as \"kicking a man while he\\'s down\" and \"bullshit\", and Steve Harvey (who said, \"Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back\"). The video also parodied Pee-wee Herman, MC Hammer and Madonna during her Blond Ambition period. \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, who parodied the Eminem song \"Lose Yourself\" on \"Couch Potato\" for his 2003 album Poodle Hat, told the Chicago Sun-Times about Jackson\\'s protest: \"Last year, Eminem forced me to halt production on the video for my \\'Lose Yourself\\' parody because he somehow thought that it would be harmful to his image or career. So the irony of this situation with Michael is not lost on me.\" Although Black Entertainment Television stopped playing the video, MTV announced that it would continue to air it. The Source, through CEO Raymond \"Benzino\" Scott, called for the video to be pulled, the song removed from the album and Eminem to apologize publicly to Jackson. In 2007, Jackson and Sony bought Famous Music from Viacom, giving him the rights to songs by Eminem, Shakira, Beck and others.\\nDespite its lead single\\'s humorous theme, Encore explored serious subject matter with the anti-war song \"Mosh\", which criticized President George W. Bush as \"This weapon of mass destruction that we call our president\", with lyrics including \"Fuck Bush.\" On October 25, 2004, a week before the 2004 US Presidential election, Eminem released the video for \"Mosh\" on the Internet. In it, Eminem gathers an army (including rapper Lloyd Banks) of Bush-administration victims and leads them to the White House. When they break in, it is learned that they are there to register to vote; the video ends with \"VOTE Tuesday November 2.\" After Bush\\'s reelection, the video\\'s ending was changed to Eminem and the protesters invading the White House during a speech by the president. Also in 2004 Eminem launched a satellite music channel, Shade 45, on Sirius radio, which was described by his manager as \"essentially a destination to get and hear things that other people aren\\'t playing.\"\\nEminem began his first US concert tour in three years in the summer of 2005 with the Anger Management 3 Tour, featuring 50 Cent, G-Unit, Lil Jon, D12, Obie Trice and the Alchemist, but in August, Eminem canceled the European leg of the tour, later announcing that he had entered drug rehabilitation for treatment of a \"dependency on sleep medication\". Meanwhile, industry insiders speculated that Eminem was considering retirement, while rumors circulated that a double album titled The Funeral would be released. In July, the Detroit Free Press reported a possible final bow for Eminem as a solo performer, quoting members of his inner circle as saying that he would embrace the roles of producer and label executive. A greatest hits album, Curtain Call: The Hits, was released on December 6, 2005, by Aftermath Entertainment, and sold nearly 441,000 copies in the US in its first week, marking Eminem\\'s fourth consecutive number-one album on the Billboard Hot 200, and was certified double platinum by the RIAA. However, Eminem suggested that month on WKQI\\'s \"Mojo in the Morning\" show that he would be taking a break as an artist: \"I\\'m at a point in my life right now where I feel like I don\\'t know where my career is going ... This is the reason that we called it \\'Curtain Call\\' because this could be the final thing. We don\\'t know.\"\\n\\nIn April 2006, Proof, who was Eminem\\'s childhood friend, was murdered. Eight months later, Eminem released a compilation album titled Eminem Presents: The Re-Up that featured Proof and other Shady Records artists.\\n\\n2007–2009: comeback and Relapse\\nIn September 2007, Eminem called New York radio station WQHT during an interview with 50 Cent, saying that he was \"in limbo\" and \"debating\" about when (or if) he would release another album: \"I\\'m always working—I\\'m always in the studio. It feels good right now, the energy of the label. For a while, I didn\\'t want to go back to the studio ... I went through some personal things. I\\'m coming out of those personal things [and] it feels good.\"\\nEminem appeared on his Shade 45 Sirius channel in September 2008, saying: \"Right now I\\'m kinda just concentrating on my own stuff, for right now and just banging out tracks and producing a lot of stuff. You know, the more I keep producing the better it seems like I get \\'cause I just start knowing stuff.\" Interscope confirmed that a new album would be released in spring 2009. In December 2008, Eminem provided more details about the album, entitled Relapse: \"Me and Dre are back in the lab like the old days, man. Dre will end up producing the majority of the tracks on \\'Relapse\\'. We are up to our old mischievous ways ... let\\'s just leave it at that.\"\\nAccording to a March 5, 2009, press release, Eminem would release two new albums that year. Relapse, the first, was released on May 19; its first single and music video, \"We Made You\", had been released on April 7. Although Relapse did not sell as well as Eminem\\'s previous albums and received mixed reviews, it was a commercial success and re-established his presence in the hip hop world. It sold more than five million copies worldwide. On October 30 he headlined at the Voodoo Experience in New Orleans, his first full performance of the year. Eminem\\'s act included several songs from Relapse, many of his older hits and an appearance by D12. On November 19, he announced on his website that Relapse: Refill would be released on December 21. The album was a re-release of Relapse with seven bonus tracks, including \"Forever\" and \"Taking My Ball\". Eminem described the CD:\\n\\nI want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned ... Hopefully, these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until we put out Relapse 2 next year ... I got back in with Dre and then a few more producers, including Just Blaze, and went in a completely different direction which made me start from scratch. The new tracks started to sound very different than the tracks I originally intended to be on Relapse 2, but I still want the other stuff to be heard.\\n\\n2009–2011: Recovery and Bad Meets Evil reunion\\nOn April 14, 2010, Eminem tweeted: \"There is no Relapse 2\". Although his followers thought he was not releasing an album, he had changed its title to Recovery and confirmed this by tweeting \"Recovery\" with a link to his website. He said:\\n\\nI had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title.\\nRecorded from 2009 to 2010, Recovery was released on June 18. In the US, Recovery sold 741,000 copies during its first week, topping the Billboard 200 chart. Eminem\\'s sixth consecutive US number-one album also topped the charts in several other countries. Recovery remained atop the Billboard 200 chart for five consecutive weeks of a seven-week total.\\nBillboard reported that it was the bestselling album of 2010, making Eminem the first artist in Nielsen SoundScan history with two year-end bestselling albums. Recovery is the bestselling digital album in history. Its first single, \"Not Afraid\", was released on April 29 and debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100; its music video was released on June 4. \"Not Afraid\" was followed by \"Love the Way You Lie\", which debuted at number two before rising to the top. Although \"Love the Way You Lie\" was the bestselling 2010 single in the United Kingdom, it did not reach number one (the first time this has happened in the UK since 1969). Despite criticism of its inconsistency, Recovery received positive reviews from most critics. As of November 21, 2010, the album had US sales of three million copies. Recovery was the bestselling album worldwide in 2010, joining 2002\\'s bestseller The Eminem Show to give Eminem two worldwide year-end number-one albums. With Recovery, Eminem broke the record for the most successive US number-one albums by a solo artist.\\nHe appeared at the 2010 BET Awards, performing \"Not Afraid\" and \"Airplanes, Part II\" with B.o.B and Keyshia Cole. Later that year, he performed at the Activison E3 concert. In June, Eminem and Jay-Z announced they would perform together in Detroit and New York City, at concerts called The Home & Home Tour. The first two concerts quickly sold out, prompting an additional show in each city. BET called Eminem the number-one rapper of the 21st century. He opened the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, performing \"Not Afraid\" and \"Love the Way You Lie\" with Rihanna singing the choruses. Due to the success of Recovery and the Home & Home Tour, Eminem was named the 2010 Hottest MC in the Game by MTV and Emcee of the Year by the online magazine HipHopDX. He and Rihanna again collaborated on \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\", the sequel of their hit single. Unlike the original, Rihanna is the lead vocalist and it is sung from the female perspective. In December 2010, the \"Great Eminem Recovery\" was number one on Billboard\\'s Top 25 Music Moments of 2010. He appeared at the 2011 Grammy Awards on February 13, performing \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\" with Rihanna and Adam Levine and \"I Need a Doctor\" with Dr. Dre and Skylar Grey. That month it was announced that \"Space Bound\" would be the fourth single from Recovery, with a music video featuring former porn actress Sasha Grey; the video was released June 24 on the iTunes Store.\\n\\nIn 2010, Eminem again began collaborating with Royce da 5\\'9\" on their first EP as Bad Meets Evil; the duo formed in 1998. The EP, Hell: The Sequel, was released on June 14, 2011. Eminem was featured on Royce da 5\\'9\"\\'s \"Writer\\'s Block\", released on April 8, 2011. On May 3 they released the lead single \"Fast Lane\" from their upcoming EP and a music video was filmed. In March 2011, within days of each other, The Eminem Show and The Marshall Mathers LP were certified diamond by the RIAA; Eminem is the only rapper with two diamond-certified albums. With more than 60 million \"likes\" he was the most-followed person on Facebook, outscoring Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Rihanna and Michael Jackson. Eminem was the first artist in five years with two number-one albums (Recovery and Hell: The Sequel) in a 12-month period. Early in 2011 he leaked \"2.0 Boys\", on which Yelawolf and Slaughterhouse collaborated when they signed with Shady Records in January and performed it in April. Bad Meets Evil released their next single, \"Lighters\", on July 6 and its music video in late August. On August 6, Eminem performed several songs from throughout his career at Lollapalooza with the artists who had been featured on each song.\\n\\n2012–2014: The Marshall Mathers LP 2\\nEminem announced on May 24, 2012, that he was working on his next album, scheduled for release the following year. Without a title or release date, it was included on a number of \"Most Anticipated Albums of 2013\" lists (including MTV); Complex ranked it sixth and XXL fifth.\\nOn August 14, \"Survival\", featuring Liz Rodrigues and produced by DJ Khalil, premiered in the multi-player trailer for the video game Call of Duty: Ghosts. According to a press release, the first single from Eminem\\'s eighth album would be released soon. During the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, it was announced that the album would be entitled The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (following The Marshall Mathers LP) and was scheduled for release on November 5. Its lead single, \"Berzerk\", was released on August 25 and debuted at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Three more singles followed: \"Survival\" (appearing on the Call of Duty: Ghosts trailer), \"Rap God\" and \"The Monster\" (with Rihanna).\\nThe album was released on November 5, by Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records and Interscope Records. Its standard version had 16 tracks and the deluxe version included a second disc with five additional tracks. The Marshall Mathers LP 2 was Eminem\\'s seventh album to debut atop the Billboard 200 and had the year\\'s second-largest first-week sales. He was the first artist since the Beatles to have four singles in the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100. In the United Kingdom, The Marshall Mathers LP 2 debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart. The first American artist with seven consecutive UK number-one albums, he is tied with the Beatles for second place for the most consecutive chart-topping UK albums. The album secured Eminem\\'s position as Canada\\'s bestselling artist and was 2013\\'s bestselling album.\\nOn November 3, Eminem was named the first YouTube Music Awards Artist of the Year, and a week later he received the Global Icon Award at the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards. On June 10, it was announced that Eminem was the first artist to receive two digital diamond certifications—sales and streams of 10 million and above—by the RIAA (for \"Not Afraid\" and \"Love the Way You Lie\"). On July 11 and 12, Eminem played two concerts in Wembley Stadium. At the 57th Grammy Awards, he received Best Rap Album award for The Marshall Mathers LP 2 and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration (with Rihanna) for \"The Monster\".\\n\\n2014–2016: Shady XV and Southpaw\\nIn the summer of 2014, Eminem and Rosenberg began using the hashtag #SHADYXV on social networking sites and Eminem wore a T-shirt with the hashtag onstage.

In the song, Eminem calls the newly elected President Donald Trump a \"bitch\" and also raps about raping conservative social and political commentator Ann Coulter, who is a Trump supporter, with a variety of foreign objects. Coulter responded to the lyrics, stating, \"I think it\\'s unfortunate that the left, from Berkeley to Eminem with his rap songs, has normalized violence against women, as Eminem has done.\" Eminem participated in the 2017 BET Hip Hop Awards\\' annual cypher, using his verse, a freestyle rap called \"The Storm\", to further criticize Trump and the administration for, among other things, Trump\\'s focus on National Football League players\\' protests during \"The Star Spangled Banner\" over Hurricane Maria recovery efforts and lack of gun control reform in the wake of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. Eminem ended the cypher by giving an ultimatum saying that Trump supporters cannot be his fans. The verse received wide praise among other rappers following its release. In October 2017, Eminem appeared on \"Revenge\", a track from Pink\\'s album Beautiful Trauma. It was reported that the Secret Service interviewed Eminem in 2018–2019, regarding threatening lyrics towards President Trump and daughter Ivanka.\\nStarting in late October 2017, Eminem and Paul Rosenberg began teasing what fans speculated was the title of a new album titled Revival, in the form of advertisements for a fake medication of the same name. Later in November, the first single \"Walk on Water\" was released, which featured Beyoncé. The song was first performed, by Eminem, at the 2017 MTV Europe Music Awards on November 12, featuring Skylar Grey. He appeared on Saturday Night Live on November 18, performing \"Walk on Water\", \"Stan\" and \"Love the Way You Lie\" with Skylar Grey.

Despite an online leak of the album two days prior, Revival was released as planned on December 15. On January 5, 2018, the second single \"River\" was released, which featured Ed Sheeran. It became Eminem\\'s eighth consecutive album to top the US Billboard 200 upon release with 197,000 copies sold in its first week. As a result, he became the first musical act to have eight entries in a row debut atop the chart. The album was met with mixed reviews from music critics and is generally considered his worst album. In 2018, an extended edition of \"Nowhere Fast\" with Kehlani and a remix of \"Chloraseptic\" featuring 2 Chainz and Phresher were released from Revival.\\nOn August 31, 2018, Eminem released his tenth studio album and first surprise album Kamikaze, making it his second full-length studio album in 8 months. The album topped the Billboard 200, making it his ninth album in a row to do so, after selling 434,000 units in the first week. The album was released as a response to criticism of Revival, his worst rated album. The album was promoted with three singles: \"Fall\", \"Venom\" from the 2018 film of the same name, and \"Lucky You\".

Music critics praised Eminem\\'s lyrical abilities and the improved production after Kamikaze, while criticism directed towards the album\\'s formulaic song structure, lack of innovation and shock value.\\nThe lyrics of \"Unaccommodating\", in which Eminem referenced the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, drew significant criticism, with many critics finding the lyrics objectionable. The mayor of Manchester denounced the song\\'s lyrics, describing them as \"unnecessarily hurtful and deeply disrespectful\". The lyrics also drew widespread criticism from victims\\' relatives and others involved in the attack. On February 9, 2020, Mathers performed \"Lose Yourself\" at the 92nd Academy Awards. On March 9, 2020, the music video for the song \"Godzilla\" was released on YouTube through Lyrical Lemonade\\'s channel. The video features Mike Tyson and Dr. Dre.

The song features disses aimed at Benzino, who has had a long-time beef with Eminem, with lines like \"I have a riddle, one condition you mustn\\'t laugh. What is the opposite of Benzino? A giraffe\". The disses are a response to Benzino\\'s track \"Rap Elvis\".\\nDuring an episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! on March 19, 2024, Dr. Dre stated that Eminem intended to release a new album that year. On April 25, Eminem appeared alongside Roger Goodell at the opening ceremony of the 2024 NFL draft in Detroit. At the same time, Eminem announced a twelfth studio album titled The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce), with a planned release later in the year. The trailer for the album, which was shown on the NFL Network, briefly discusses the \"murder\" of the Slim Shady persona in a true crime format. 50 Cent is also featured in a cameo role. The album is produced by Dr. Dre and The ICU.\\nOn May 28, 2024, the rapper posted a joint Instagram video with magician David Blaine. The video shows a video call between Eminem and Blaine, with the former asking for help and a magic trick to which the latter responds by eating a glass of wine. The rapper then previews the track \"Houdini\" by playing a short instrumental snippet. At the end of the clip, the song title and release date are revealed. It was released on May 31, 2024, as the lead single. It topped the charts in many countries, as well as debuting at number 1 on the Billboard Global 200 and number 2 on the Hot 100.\\nOn June 28, 2024, Eminem posted a teaser for the album\\'s second single, titled \"Tobey\" and featuring fellow Detroit rappers Big Sean and BabyTron. The short black-and-white clip depicted the rapper wearing a Jason mask and wielding a chainsaw while standing next to the featured artists, with an instrumental snippet playing in the background. The song released on July 2, with an accompanying music video produced by Cole Bennett to follow on July 5. The track title is a reference to actor Tobey Maguire, best known for his role in the Spider-Man films. The single art is also a reference to the iconic \"3 spiderman pointing\" meme.\\n\\nArtistry\\nInfluences, style and rapping technique\\nEminem has cited several MCs as influencing his rapping style, including Esham, Kool G Rap, Masta Ace, Big Daddy Kane, Tupac Shakur, Newcleus, Ice-T, Mantronix, Melle Mel (on \"The Message\"), LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, Run-D.M.C., Rakim and Boogie Down Productions.\\nIn How to Rap, Guerilla Black notes that Eminem studied other MCs to hone his rapping technique: \"Eminem listened to everything and that\\'s what made him one of the greats\". In the book, other MCs also praise aspects of his rapping technique: varied, humorous subject matter, connecting with his audience, carrying a concept over a series of albums, complex rhyme schemes, bending words so they rhyme, multisyllabic rhymes, many rhymes to a bar, complex rhythms, clear enunciation, and the use of melody and syncopation. Eminem is known to write most of his lyrics on paper (documented in The Way I Am), taking several days or a week to craft lyrics, being a \"workaholic\" and \"stacking\" vocals. Examples of hip hop subgenres that Eminem\\'s music has been described as include horrorcore, comedy hip hop, and hardcore hip hop. Eminem also incorporates rap rock into his music and has cited rock acts during the 1970s and 1980s, such as Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin, as influences in his music.\\n\\nAlter egos\\nEminem uses alter egos in his songs for different rapping styles and subject matter. His best-known alter ego, Slim Shady, first appeared on the Slim Shady EP and was in The Slim Shady LP, The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Encore, Relapse, The Marshall Mathers LP 2, Kamikaze and Music to Be Murdered By. In this persona, his songs are violent and dark, with a comic twist. Eminem downplayed Slim Shady on Recovery because he felt it did not fit the album\\'s theme. The end of the character is suggested to be with The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce) LP in 2024.\\nAnother character is Ken Kaniff, a gay man who pokes fun at Eminem\\'s songs. Ken was created and originally played by fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle on the Slim Shady LP, where Kaniff makes a prank call to Eminem. An argument after the album\\'s release prompted Eminem to use the Kaniff character on Marshall Mathers and later albums (except Encore and Recovery). Aristotle, angry with Eminem\\'s use of his character, released a mixtape in his Kaniff persona ridiculing him.\\n\\nCollaborations and productions\\nAlthough Eminem usually collaborates with Aftermath Entertainment and Shady Records rappers such as Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, D12, Obie Trice and Yelawolf, he has also worked with Redman, Kid Rock, DMX, Lil Wayne, Missy Elliott, Jay Z, Drake, Rihanna, Nas, Nicki Minaj, Xzibit, Method Man, Jadakiss, Fat Joe, Sticky Fingaz, T.I. and Young Jeezy. Eminem rapped a verse in a live performance of Busta Rhymes\\' \"Touch It\" remix at the 2006 BET Music Awards. He appeared on Akon\\'s single \"Smack That\" from Konvicted, Lil Wayne\\'s hit \"Drop the World\" and \"My Life\" (the lead single from 50 Cent\\'s Street King Immortal).\\nEminem was the executive producer of D12\\'s first two albums (Devil\\'s Night and D12 World), Obie Trice\\'s Cheers and Second Round\\'s on Me and 50 Cent\\'s Get Rich or Die Tryin\\' and The Massacre. He has produced songs for other rappers such as Jadakiss\\' \"Welcome To D-Block\", Jay-Z\\'s \"Renegade\" and \"Moment of Clarity\", Lloyd Banks\\' \"On Fire\", \"Warrior Part 2\" and \"Hands Up\", Tony Yayo\\'s \"Drama Setter\", Trick-Trick\\'s \"Welcome 2 Detroit\" and Xzibit\\'s \"My Name\" and \"Don\\'t Approach Me\". Most of The Eminem Show was produced by Eminem and his longtime collaborator, Jeff Bass, and Eminem co-produced Encore with Dr. Dre. In 2004, Eminem was co-executive producer of 2Pac\\'s posthumous album Loyal to the Game with Shakur\\'s mother, Afeni. He produced the UK number-one single \"Ghetto Gospel\", featuring Elton John; \"The Cross\", from the Nas album God\\'s Son; and eight tracks on Obie Trice\\'s 2006 album Second Round\\'s on Me (also appearing on \"There They Go\"). Eminem produced several tracks on Trick-Trick\\'s The Villain (appearing on \"Who Want It\") and produced four tracks on Cashis\\' 2013 album The County Hound 2.\\nEminem has only produced for and appeared on one track with former Aftermath/Interscope labelmate The Game; \"We Ain\\'t\" (a track from Game\\'s January 2005 debut album, The Documentary). In 2022, Game would later release a ten-minute diss track towards Eminem titled \"The Black Slim Shady\".\\nEminem is considered unusual in structuring his songs around the lyrics, rather than writing to beats. One exception was \"Stan\", which came from an idea and scratch track produced by the 45 King. After doing little production on Relapse and Recovery, Eminem produced a significant portion of The Marshall Mathers LP 2. He said about producing his own music, \"Sometimes, I may get something in my head, like an idea or the mood of something that I would want, and I\\'m not always gonna get that by going through different tracks that other people have made. They don\\'t know what\\'s in my head. I think maybe it helps, a little bit, with diversity, the sound of it, but also, I would get something in my head and want to be able to lay down that idea from scratch.\" In 1998 when his beef with rapper Cage was still happening, New York rapper Necro (who had previously produced three songs for Cage) met Eminem and gave him a CD with the beat to what eventually became the beat for the song \"Black Helicopters\" by rap group Non-Phixion. Despite Eminem never using it, Necro still said positive things about Eminem and would appear on Shade45 years later.\\n\\nComparisons with other artists\\nAs a white performer prominent in a genre influenced by black artists, Eminem has been compared, much to his chagrin, to Elvis Presley, and has lyrically been compared to Bob Dylan. Rapper Asher Roth has been compared to Eminem and Roth devoted a song on his album (\"As I Em\") to him, which Eminem took offense to. The accomplished trumpeter Nicholas Payton has called Eminem \"the Bix Beiderbecke of hip hop\".\\n\\nOther ventures\\nShady Records\\nFollowing Eminem\\'s multiplatinum record sales, Interscope offered him his own label; he and Paul Rosenberg founded Shady Records in late 1999. Eminem signed his Detroit collective, D12 and rapper Obie Trice to the label and signed 50 Cent in a 2002 joint venture with Dr. Dre\\'s Aftermath label. In 2003, Eminem and Dr. Dre added Atlanta rapper Stat Quo to the Shady-Aftermath roster. DJ Green Lantern, Eminem\\'s former DJ, was with Shady Records until a dispute related to the 50 Cent-Jadakiss feud forced him to leave the label. The Alchemist is currently Eminem\\'s tour DJ. In 2005 Eminem signed another Atlanta rapper, Bobby Creekwater and West Coast rapper Cashis to Shady Records.\\nOn December 5, 2006, the compilation album Eminem Presents: The Re-Up was released on Shady Records. The project began as a mixtape, but when Eminem found the material better than expected he released it as an album. The Re-Up was intended to introduce Stat Quo, Cashis and Bobby Creekwater. While he was recording Infinite, Eminem, Proof and Kon Artis assembled a group of fellow rappers now known as D12, short for \"Detroit Twelve\" or \"Dirty Dozen\", who performed in a style similar to Wu-Tang Clan. In 2001 D12\\'s debut album, Devil\\'s Night, was released. The first single from the album was \"Shit on You\", followed by \"Purple Pills\" (an ode to recreational drug use) and \"Fight Music\". \"Purple Pills\" was rewritten for radio and television, removing many of the song\\'s references to drugs and sex and renamed \"Purple Hills\".\\nAfter their debut, D12 took a three-year break from the studio. They reunited in 2004 for their second album, D12 World, which included the hit singles \"My Band\" and \"How Come\". \"American Psycho 2\" featuring Cypress Hill member, B-Real, was another popular hit. According to D12 member Bizarre, Eminem was not featured on his album Blue Cheese & Coney Island because \"he\\'s busy doing his thing\".\\nIn January 2014, Bass Brothers announced that D12 had returned to record at F.B.T. Studio and they were working on an album with Eminem on at least three songs. Bizarre reported that he was still part of the group and that the album was scheduled for a 2014 release.\\n\\nShade 45\\nEminem established his own satellite radio channel, Shade 45, that plays uncut hip hop. Eminem also established a new morning show, Sway in the Morning with Sway Calloway, a lively morning show that airs at 8:00 a.m., Monday–Friday.\\nEminem promoted the station in a 2004 mock national convention (the \"Shady National Convention\") at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City, in which Donald Trump endorsed him. On his album Revival (2017), Eminem expressed his regret at having collaborated with Trump, rapping, \"wish I would have spit on it before I went to shake his hand at the event\".\\n\\nMom\\'s Spaghetti Restaurant\\nOn September 29, 2021, Eminem and Union Joints opened a spaghetti restaurant at 2131 Woodward Ave in Detroit. It is a reference to the lyrics \"His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy / There\\'s vomit on his sweater already, mom\\'s spaghetti\" from the song \"Lose Yourself\" which became an internet meme. Mom\\'s Spaghetti was previously a pop-up in Detroit in 2017 and at Coachella in 2018.\\nIn 2023, Eminem announced the launch of a \"Mom\\'s Spaghetti\" jarred pasta sauce.\\n\\nActing career\\nAfter small roles in the 2001 film The Wash and as an extra in the 1998 Korn music video for \"Got the Life\" (during which he gave the band a demo tape), Eminem made his Hollywood debut in the semi-autobiographical 2002 film 8 Mile. He said it was a representation of growing up in Detroit rather than an account of his life. He recorded several new songs for the soundtrack, including \"Lose Yourself\" (which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2003 and became the longest-running No. 1 hip hop single in history). Eminem was absent from the ceremony and co-composer Luis Resto accepted the award.\\nEminem voiced an aging, corrupt, AAVE-speaking police officer in the video game 50 Cent: Bulletproof and guested on the Comedy Central television show Crank Yankers and a Web cartoon, The Slim Shady Show He was signed to star in an unmade film version of Have Gun – Will Travel, and was considered for the role of David Rice in the 2008 film Jumper. Eminem had a cameo appearance, arguing with Ray Romano, in the 2009 film Funny People. In a 2010 interview with Jonathan Ross, he stated \"You know, I love music so much. This is my passion, this is what I want to do. Not saying that I won\\'t do a movie ever again, but this is me.\"\\nHe played himself in the Entourage season-seven finale \"Lose Yourself\" with Christina Aguilera. Although Eminem was offered the lead role in the 2013 science-fiction film Elysium, he turned it down because director Neill Blomkamp would not change its location from Los Angeles to Detroit. Eminem had a cameo appearance as himself in the 2014 film The Interview. During an interview with the main character, Dave Skylark (James Franco), Eminem satirically comes out as gay.\\n\\nCharity work\\nEminem established the Marshall Mathers Foundation to aid disadvantaged youth. The foundation works in conjunction with a charity founded by Norman Yatooma, a Detroit attorney. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Eminem donated a pair of Air Jordan 4 Retro Eminem Carhartt shoes, which are rare, to be raffled off with proceeds going to COVID-19 relief. That same year, he donated \"mom\\'s spaghetti\", a reference to a line in his song \"Lose Yourself\", to healthcare workers at Henry Ford Health System in Detroit.\\n\\nAdvertising\\nEminem appeared in two commercials which were shown during Super Bowl XLV. In the first, a one-minute spot for Lipton\\'s Brisk iced tea, he is a claymation figure. In the second, a two-minute ad—the longest in Super Bowl history at the time—for the Chrysler 200, Eminem drives through Detroit (with \"Lose Yourself\" as the soundtrack) to his show at the Fox Theatre.\\n\\nBooks and memoirs\\nOn November 21, 2000, Eminem published Angry Blonde, a non-fiction book featuring a commentary of several of his own songs, along with several previously unpublished photographs.\\nOn October 21, 2008, his autobiography The Way I Am was published. The book was first published on October 21, 2008, by Dutton Adult. It is a collection of Eminem\\'s personal stories, reflections, photographs, original artwork, and original lyric sheets from \"Stan\" and \"The Real Slim Shady\". It details his struggles with poverty, drugs, fame, heartbreak, family and depression, along with stories about his rise to fame and commentary on past controversies. The book is illustrated with never before published photos of Eminem\\'s life. It also contains original drawings, previously unpublished lyric sheets, and other rare memorabilia. The autobiography is named after his 2000 song \"The Way I Am\".\\nAn autobiography of Eminem\\'s mother (My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem) was published the following month, in which Debbie Nelson describes her childhood and adolescence, meeting Eminem\\'s father and her son\\'s rise to (and struggles with) fame.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nFamily and relationships\\nHe was twice married to Kimberly Anne Scott; he met Scott in high school while he stood on a table with his shirt off rapping LL Cool J\\'s \"I\\'m Bad\". Scott and her twin sister had run away from home; they moved in with Eminem and his mother when he was 15 and he began an on-and-off relationship with Scott in January 14, 1991. Their daughter Hailie Jade, who is Mathers\\'s only biological child, was born on December 25, 1995.\\nMathers and Scott were married in June 14, 1999, and divorced in October 12, 2001. Although Eminem told Rolling Stone in 2002, \"I would rather have a baby through my penis than get married again\", he and Scott briefly remarried in January 14, 2006. He filed for divorce in early April, agreeing to joint custody of Hailie and finalize divorce  on December 18, 2006 In early 2010, Eminem denied tabloid reports that he and Scott had renewed their romantic relationship; however, in the same statement, his representative also confirmed that they now maintain a friendly relationship.\\nTheir daughter, Hailie, is a social media influencer, specifically for fashion and beauty. She married her long-term partner Evan McClintock on May 20, 2024, with Eminem, Dr. Dre and 50 Cent among those in attendance.\\nEminem legally adopted and was given custody of his sister-in-law\\'s daughter Alaina Marie, as well as Scott\\'s child from an affair, Stevie Laine. He also raised his younger half-brother Nathan.\\nEminem and actress Brittany Murphy dated in the 2000s. He stated in 2002 that he had been dating singer Mariah Carey, though she later denied it. In 2005, he played alleged voicemails of her during the Anger Management Tour and stated in 2006 that he had dated her for six to seven months, but the two broke up due to the differences in their personalities.\\nIn his 2013 song \"Headlights\", Eminem reiterated his love for his mother and apologized to her for some of the lyrics from his songs, with \"Cleanin\\' Out My Closet\" being specifically named.\\n\\nHealth problems\\nEminem has spoken publicly about his addiction to prescription drugs, including Vicodin, Ambien and Valium. According to friend and fellow D12 member Proof, Eminem first straightened out in 2002. During the production of 8 Mile, Eminem, working 16 hours a day, developed insomnia. An associate gave him an Ambien tablet which \"knocked [him] out\", encouraging him to obtain a prescription. This was Eminem\\'s first experience of drug addiction, which would affect him for several years. Near the end of production on Encore, he would \"just go into the studio and goof off [with] a pocketful of pills\". Eminem began taking the drugs to \"feel normal\", taking a \"ridiculous amount ... I could consume anywhere from 40 to 60 Valium [in a day]. Vicodin, maybe 30.\" The drugs would put him to sleep for no more than two hours, after which he would take more. Eminem\\'s weight increased to 230 pounds (100 kg) and he was regularly eating fast food: \"The kids behind the counter knew me—it wouldn\\'t even faze them. Or I\\'d sit up at Denny\\'s or Big Boy and just eat by myself. It was sad.\" Eminem became less recognizable due to his weight gain and once overheard two teenagers arguing about whether or not it was him: \"Eminem ain\\'t fat.\"\\n\\nIn December 2007, Eminem was hospitalized after a methadone overdose. He had first bought from a dealer who had told him it was \"just like Vicodin, and easier on [your] liver\". He continued to buy more until he collapsed in his bathroom one night and was rushed to the hospital. Doctors there told him he had ingested the equivalent of four bags of heroin and was \"about two hours from dying\". After missing Christmas with his children, Hailie, Alaina and Stevie, Eminem checked himself out of the facility, weak and not fully detoxed. He tore the meniscus in his knee after falling asleep on his sofa, requiring surgery; after he returned home, he had a seizure. His drug use \"ramped right back to where it was before\" within a month. Eminem began to attend church meetings to get clean, but after he was asked for autographs he sought help from a rehabilitation counselor. He began an exercise program that emphasized running. Elton John was a mentor during this period, calling Eminem once a week to check on him. Eminem has been sober since April 20, 2008.\\n\\nThreats\\nIn April 2020, Matthew David Hughes, a 26-year-old homeless man, broke into Eminem\\'s house in Clinton Township, Macomb County, Michigan, breaking a kitchen window with a brick paver. Eminem woke up with Hughes standing behind him and Hughes said that he was there to kill Eminem. In a plea agreement in 2021, Hughes pleaded guilty to second-degree home invasion in exchange for dismissal of other charges; he was sentenced to probation and time served (524 days in the county jail). In 2019, Hughes had pleaded guilty to breaking into a Rochester Hills home in search of Eminem.\\nOn August 30, 2023, it was revealed that the perpetrator of the 2023 Jacksonville shooting Ryan Palmeter targeted Eminem and Machine Gun Kelly as his victims in a racially-motivated attack.\\n\\nPolitics\\nIn multiple songs, Eminem has expressed political views that align with the Democratic Party; however, he has refrained from direct endorsements of politicians, focusing more on criticisms instead. The first was \"Mosh\", which was released in 2004, a few weeks before the 2004 United States presidential election, and heavily criticized then-president George W. Bush but did not directly endorse John Kerry either. Eminem would not express political views again until the 2016 United States presidential election when he released \"Campaign Speech\", which criticized presidential candidate Donald Trump. The following year, Eminem criticized Trump in a freestyle titled \"The Storm\". In the freestyle, Eminem expressed support for former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and the U.S. national anthem protests, and expressed his displeasure for any of his fans that support Trump. In his song \"Darkness\", Eminem heavily references the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting, and at the end of the music video expresses his support for gun control. The week before the 2020 United States presidential election, Eminem approved his song \"Lose Yourself\" to be used in a campaign video for Joe Biden. After the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Eminem posted a tweet to his Twitter expressing his displeasure for the decision saying \"As a father it pisses me off that women have fewer rights 2day than just a few days ago… we r fuckin goin bckwards. Here\\'s how 2 help in Michigan. [sic]\" and included a link to a pro-choice organization in Michigan. In 2023, he requested that Republican election candidate Vivek Ramaswamy stop rapping his song \"Lose Yourself\" at campaign rallies, sending Ramaswamy a cease and desist letter.\\n\\nFaith and beliefs\\nEminem is a Christian, and has rapped about his faith in a few songs, most notably on the remix to \"Use This Gospel\".\\n\\nInterests\\nEminem is a fan of the Detroit Lions and Detroit Pistons.\\n\\nFeuds\\nEminem has had lyrical feuds during his career with many recording artists, including Christina Aguilera, Machine Gun Kelly, Everlast, Cage, Insane Clown Posse, Will Smith, Miilkbone, Mariah Carey, Nick Cannon, Limp Bizkit, Benzino, Ja Rule, Vanilla Ice, Canibus, Jermaine Dupri, Joe Budden, Lord Jamar, and Charlamagne tha God.\\n\\nInsane Clown Posse\\nThe feud with fellow Detroit hip hop duo Insane Clown Posse began in 1997, when Eminem was throwing a party to promote his debut EP, Slim Shady EP. He gave Joseph Bruce (aka Violent J from Insane Clown Posse) a flyer which stated \"Featuring appearances by Esham, Kid Rock, and ICP (maybe)\". Bruce asked why Eminem was promoting a possible Insane Clown Posse appearance without first contacting the group. Eminem explained, \"It says \\'maybe.\\' Maybe you will be there; I don\\'t know. That\\'s why I\\'m asking you right now. You guys comin\\' to my release party, or what?\". Bruce, upset over not being consulted, responded, \"Fuck no, I ain\\'t coming to your party. We might have, if you would\\'ve asked us first, before putting us on the fuckin\\' flyer like this.\"\\nEminem took Bruce\\'s response as a personal offense, subsequently attacking the group in radio interviews. Bruce and Utsler responded with a parody of Eminem\\'s \"My Name Is\" entitled \"Slim Anus\" and other tracks including \"Nuttin\\' But a Bitch Thang\" and \"Please Don\\'t Hate Me\". Eminem insulted Insane Clown Posse on various tracks from his album The Marshall Mathers LP (2000), including \"Marshall Mathers\" and \"Ken Kaniff\". In 2002, Eminem briefly dissed them on his single \"Business\" from The Eminem Show.\\nInsane Clown Posse talked about the feud being squashed in an interview with MTV, saying that Proof squashed the conflict in 2005, which was followed by a bowling game between members of D12 and Psychopathic Records. Violent J stated that, \"He contacted us and we had a bowling game—it was really cool. We\\'re something different. They could have skipped over us and said forget them, but they included us and said let\\'s squash it.\"\\n\\nEverlast and Limp Bizkit\\nIn the early 2000s, Eminem was notified while on the Anger Management Tour that former House of Pain member Everlast had mocked him on a song. Everlast claimed that while passing by Mathers in a hotel lobby, Mathers gave him a \"weird look\". Everlast\\'s verse from the Dilated Peoples all star track \"Ear Drums Pop (Remix)\" contained a thinly veiled reference to Eminem (\"Cock my hammer, spit a comet like Haley/I buck a .380 on ones that act shady\") and went on to warn \"You might catch a beatdown out where I come from\" in his recounting of the incident. Taking offense to this, Eminem and D12 quickly began work on a retaliatory song, \"I Remember\", which ripped Everlast several times in public and with the song.\\nEminem and his group D12 responded with \"Quitter\", the second half of which is a take off on 2Pac\\'s iconic disstrack \"Hit \\'Em Up\" (a diss song aimed at The Notorious B.I.G.). The track ends with the spoken words, \"Fuck him, that\\'s it, I\\'m done, I promise, I\\'m done, that\\'s it.\"\\nIt was reported that long-time friends of Eminem, nu metal group Limp Bizkit, were meant to be featured on the song, but lead singer Fred Durst canceled at the last moment. The record continued to be released without the group, causing the Everlast-Mathers dispute to continue. In a TRL interview, Limp Bizkit member DJ Lethal, made a statement that if Mathers and Everlast were to fight in real life, Everlast would win. This would lead to an insulting track aimed at both Everlast and Limp Bizkit (namely Durst and Lethal) appearing on D12\\'s 2001 mainstream debut album, Devil\\'s Night, as the track \"Girls\".\\nRecently, things seem to have settled and Eminem has no longer been heard insulting Everlast or Limp Bizkit. It is currently unknown if the dispute is resolved. During Eminem\\'s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction speech in 2022, he credited House of Pain as an influence.\\n\\nCanibus\\nThe animus with rapper Canibus started when Canibus and Haitian musician Wyclef Jean confronted Eminem and asked him if he had ghost-wrote the track \"The Ripper Strikes Back\" by LL Cool J. Eminem denied that he wrote the track. After he was confronted, Eminem said Canibus was \"rude\" to him.\\nTwo years later, Canibus went to see Eminem on the Warped Tour and apologized to him for his reactions and asked him if he still wanted the track. Eminem agreed, but when he heard the track \"Phuck U\" from Canibus\\' album 2000 B.C., he thought the track was directed at him and LL Cool J. Shortly afterwards, Eminem released his third album The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and Canibus decided to continue the \"story\" of Eminem\\'s single \"Stan\". He titled the track \"U Didn\\'t Care\" and it continued to take shots at Eminem. Eminem decided to take more shots at Canibus on his album The Eminem Show (2002) on tracks such as \"Say What You Say\", \"When The Music Stops\" and \"Square Dance\". Even though Canibus did not immediately respond to the tracks, Eminem continued to take shots at him, including \"My Name\", a track that Eminem was featured on Xzibit\\'s album Man vs. Machine (2002).\\nOn November 19, 2002, Canibus responded with the track titled \"Dr.\\u200dC PhD\". Over a year later Eminem released the track \"Can-I-Bitch\". He attacked Canibus in a humorous matter. Since then the hostilities have cooled down, but Canibus tried to provoke a reignition of it when he leaked a track titled \"Air Strike (Pop Killer)\", that featured vocal parts of D12, where Canibus takes shots at Eminem and his deceased friend Proof. D12 member Swift responded to the record publicly and had the following to say about DZK (another rapper featured on the track). \"[He] asked us to do a track with him when he already was teamed up with Canibus without us knowing. They dissed Em, took our verses, and added them to the song, so they can bring traffic and make it seem like we were turning on Em [...] as a desperate attempt to be heard after ducking and dodging Em for 7 years. It was a straight hoe move.\"\\n\\nMichael Jackson\\nThe 2004 music video for \"Just Lose It\" generated controversy by parodying pop icon Michael Jackson\\'s child molestation trial, plastic surgery and an incident in which Jackson\\'s hair caught on fire while filming a Pepsi commercial in 1984. It was banned on the BET channel, after complaints from Benzino and others (but was later reinstated, as critics of the ban argued that Nelly\\'s \"Tip Drill\" video could be seen). Both were only seen on BET: Uncut. However, MTV did not drop it, and the video became one of the most requested on the channel. A week after the release of \"Just Lose It\", Jackson called in to the radio show of Steve Harvey to report his displeasure with the video. \"I am very angry at Eminem\\'s depiction of me in his video\", Jackson said in the interview. \"I feel that it is outrageous and disrespectful. It is one thing to spoof, but it is another to be demeaning and insensitive.\" The singer continued: \"I\\'ve admired Eminem as an artist, and was shocked by this. The video was inappropriate and disrespectful to me, my children, my family and the community at large.\" Many of Jackson\\'s supporters and friends spoke out about the video, including Stevie Wonder, who called the video \"kicking a man while he\\'s down\" and \"bullshit\", and Steve Harvey, who declared, \"Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back.\"\\n\\nJa Rule\\nEminem\\'s conflict with rapper Ja Rule started after 50 Cent signed to Shady Records and Aftermath. Ja Rule stated that he had a problem with Eminem and Dr. Dre of signing someone he had conflict with.\\nOn November 19, Ja Rule and Irv Gotti were special guests on Star and Bucwild\\'s morning show on Hot 97 NYC. Gotti claimed to have \"legal documents\" referring to an order of protection 50 Cent \"has on him\". Ja Rule threatened, that if 50 Cent released any diss track, he would take action towards his two producers.\\nHowever, Dr. Dre was the one who produced 50 Cent\\'s track \"Back Down\" in 2003 from the album Get Rich Or Die Tryin\\', which included lyrics insulting not only Murder Inc., but also Ja Rule\\'s family including his then-two-year-old son and seven-year-old daughter Britney Atkins as in the song, 50 Cent raps, \"Your Mami, your Papi, that bitch you chasin\\' your lil dirty ass kids, I\\'ll fuckin\\' erase them.\"\\nFellow rapper Busta Rhymes decided to join the conflict when he was featured on the track \"Hail Mary 2003\", with Eminem and 50 Cent.\\nThe feud intensified when Ja Rule released a diss called \"Loose Change\", in which he took shots at 50 Cent as well as Eminem (calling him \"Feminem\") and Dr. Dre (accuse him of being \"bisexual\" and having a fetish for transvestites – \"bringing transvestites home\"). It includes also the lyrics insulting Eminem\\'s family, including his then-seven-year-old daughter Hailie Jade: \"Em you claim your mother\\'s a crack head and Kim is a known slut, so what\\'s Hailie gonna be when she grows up?\". Eminem, along with D12 and Obie Trice, responded with the track \"Doe Rae Me\" (aka \"Hailie\\'s Revenge\"). Since then, the rift has allegedly cooled down.\\n\\nBenzino and The Source magazine\\nIn 2003, rapper and The Source co-owner Benzino released a diss single titled \"Pull Your Skirt Up\" which took aim at Eminem. The track attacked Eminem\\'s \"street cred\" and accused him of being a tool of the music industry. Eminem had been discovered by The Source after writer Rigo Morales featured him in the magazine\\'s famed monthly \"Unsigned Hype\" column.\\nIn the same year, The Source released an article written by Kimberly Osorio, which identified and researched the history of an old demo tape that the magazine discovered where Eminem insulted Black women and used the word \"nigger\". The demo featured a song called \"Foolish Pride\", recorded in the late 1980s when Eminem claimed to have been \"dumped\" by his African-American then-girlfriend. Eminem responded with two tracks titled \"Nail in the Coffin\" and \"The Sauce\". Benzino would later release more tracks. As a result of the conflict, Shady/Aftermath ads were pulled from the magazine. XXL, another hip hop magazine which had featured negative coverage of Shady/Aftermath artists since Eminem mocked them in his song \"Marshall Mathers\" from his 2000 album The Marshall Mathers LP, stepped in to fill the void, accepting Shady/Aftermath ads.\\nIn January 2024, Eminem reignited the feud with Benzino on a new diss track called \"Doomsday Pt. 2\".\\n\\nMariah Carey and Nick Cannon\\nEminem has written several songs referring to a relationship with R&B singer Mariah Carey, although she denies that they were ever intimate. Eminem has referenced her on many songs, including \"When the Music Stops\", \"Superman\", \"Jimmy Crack Corn\", \"Bagpipes from Baghdad\" and \"The Warning\". While \"Superman\" was released in 2003, Carey released a song entitled \"Clown\" on her album Charmbracelet, released in 2002, which makes similar references in line with her 2009 hit \"Obsessed\".\\nEminem\\'s \"Bagpipes from Baghdad\" from his album Relapse disparages Carey and rapper/then-husband Nick Cannon\\'s relationship. Cannon responded to Eminem by saying his career is based on \"racist bigotry\" and that he would get revenge on Eminem, joking that he may return to rapping. Eminem later stated that the couple misinterpreted the track and it was wishing the two the best. Cannon also stated that there were no hard feelings and that he just had to express his feelings about the song.\\nIn 2009, Carey released \"Obsessed\", about an obsessed man who claims to have been in a relationship with her. Cannon claimed that the song was not an insult directed at Eminem. However, Eminem responded in late July 2009 by releasing a track titled \"The Warning\". It contained samples of voice mail recordings which Eminem claimed were left by Carey, when the two were dating. Eminem also hinted that he had other evidence of their relationship in his possession. A little over a year later in September 2010, Cannon responded with the song \"I\\'m a Slick Rick\", making fun of Eminem.\\n\\nMoby\\nAfter the release of Eminem\\'s 2000 album The Marshall Mathers LP, popular electronic music artist Moby began speaking out against the album\\'s lyrics, citing references to misogyny and homophobia as unacceptable. Eminem responded back with insulting Moby in \"Without Me\", the lead single off his next album The Eminem Show.\\nIn 2004, Moby praised Eminem for criticizing then-U.S. president George W. Bush in the song \"Mosh\", a track from Encore. The feud has since ended. In 2022, Eminem said that he later regretted attacking Moby.\\n\\nMachine Gun Kelly\\nEminem and rapper Machine Gun Kelly have had an ongoing feud for several years, and Kelly released a diss track in response to \"Not Alike\" titled \"Rap Devil\" in September 2018; both songs were produced by Ronny J. Kelly continued the feud at a concert, calling it \"a battle between the past and the fucking future\". The song\\'s title refers to Eminem\\'s \"Rap God\" and Eminem went into the studio days later to record his own response, as did former D12 associate Bizarre. Eminem responded with \"Killshot\" on September 14 and Bizarre\\'s \"Love Tap\" was released on September 20. \"Killshot\" garnered 38.1 million streams on YouTube in its first 24 hours and over 80 million views in its first week, making it the most successful debut for a hip hop song and the third-biggest debut in the platform\\'s history. The track also debuted at number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it Eminem\\'s 20th top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. Kelly has continued the feud publicly.\\n\\nFrom Kamikaze\\nThroughout the 2018 album Kamikaze Eminem\\'s lyrics criticize other musicians, primarily mumble rappers, and several have responded publicly.\\nJa Rule responded on social media, re-igniting a feud the two had 15 years prior. 6ix9ine, Iggy Azalea, Joe Budden, Die Antwoord, Lupe Fiasco, and Lord Jamar have also responded publicly, with 6ix9ine releasing the skit \"Legend\" that raps over Eminem\\'s \"Lose Yourself\".\\n\\nControversies\\nLegal issues\\nEminem had his first run-in with the law at age 20, when he was arrested for his involvement in a drive-by shooting with a paintball gun. The case was dismissed when the victim did not appear in court.\\nOn June 3, 2000, Eminem was arrested during an altercation with Douglas Dail at a car-audio store in Royal Oak, Michigan, when Eminem pulled out an unloaded gun and pointed it at the ground. The next day, in Warren, Michigan, he was arrested again for assaulting John Guerra in the parking lot of the Hot Rock Café when he saw Guerra kissing Eminem\\'s wife. Eminem recreated the Guerra assault in \"The Kiss (Skit)\" on The Eminem Show. He pleaded guilty to possession of a concealed weapon and assault, receiving two years\\' probation; however, Guerra\\'s assault charge was dropped as part of the plea agreement. On June 28, 2001, Eminem was sentenced to one year\\'s probation and community service and was fined about $2,000 on weapon charges stemming from an argument with an employee of Psychopathic Records.\\nIn 1999, Eminem\\'s mother sued him for $10 million, claiming he was slandering her on The Slim Shady LP. Litigation concluded in 2001, resulting in an award of $1,600 for her damages.\\nOn July 7, 2000, Kim Mathers attempted suicide by slitting her wrists, later suing Eminem for defamation after describing her violent death in \"Kim\".\\nSanitation worker DeAngelo Bailey sued Eminem for $1 million in 2001, accusing him of invading his privacy by publicizing information placing Bailey in a false light in \"Brain Damage\", a song that portrays him as a violent school bully. Although Bailey admitted picking on Eminem in school, he said he merely \"bumped\" Eminem and gave him a \"little shove\". The lawsuit was dismissed on October 20, 2003; Judge Deborah Servitto, who wrote a portion of her opinion in rap-like rhyming verse, ruled that it was clear to the public that the lyrics were exaggerated.\\nOn March 31, 2002, French jazz pianist Jacques Loussier filed a $10 million lawsuit against Eminem and Dr. Dre, claiming that the beat for \"Kill You\" was taken from his instrumental \"Pulsion\". Loussier demanded that sales of The Marshall Mathers LP be halted and any remaining copies destroyed. The case was later settled out of court.\\nIn 2006, Eminem was accused of assaulting Miad Jarbou, a resident of Royal Oak, Michigan, in the bathroom of a Detroit strip club, but was never charged. Two years later, Jarbou sued Eminem for more than $25,000 in damages.\\nIn 2007, Eminem\\'s music-publishing company (Eight Mile Style) and Martin Affiliated sued Apple Inc. and Aftermath Entertainment, claiming that Aftermath was not authorized to negotiate a deal with Apple for digital downloads of 93 Eminem songs on Apple\\'s iTunes. The case against Apple was settled shortly after the trial began, in late September 2009.\\nIn July 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in F.B.T. Productions, LLC v. Aftermath Records that F.B.T. Productions and Eminem were owed a royalty of 50 percent of Aftermath\\'s net revenue from licensing his recordings to companies such as Apple, Sprint Corporation, Nextel Communications, Cingular and T-Mobile. In March 2011, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the case.\\nIn October 2013, Eminem sampled Chicago-based rap group Hotstylz\\'s 2008 viral hit, \"Lookin\\' Boy\", for his 2013 hit single \"Rap God\". The group claims that Eminem did not receive permission to use the sample, nor did he credit or compensate them. In November 2013, Hotstylz released a diss track towards Eminem titled \"Rap Fraud\", where they sample several of his songs and criticize him for not crediting them. In January 2015, TMZ reported that Hotstylz was suing Eminem and his label, Shady Records, for $8 million, for using the 25-second sample of \"Lookin\\' Boy\" on his song \"Rap God\" without their permission.\\n\\nUnited States Secret Service\\nOn December 8, 2003, the United States Secret Service reported that it was \"looking into\" allegations that Eminem threatened U.S. president George W. Bush in \"We As Americans\" (an unreleased bootleg at the time), with the lyrics: \"Fuck money, I don\\'t rap for dead presidents. I\\'d rather see the president dead, it\\'s never been said but I set precedents.\" The incident was included in the video for \"Mosh\", as a newspaper clipping on a wall with articles about unfortunate incidents in Bush\\'s career. \"We As Americans\" eventually appeared on Encore\\'s deluxe-edition bonus disc with altered lyrics. The original lyrics can be heard at the end of Immortal Technique\\'s \"Bin Laden\".\\nIn 2018–2019, the Secret Service interviewed Eminem again regarding threatening lyrics towards president Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka.\\n\\nAllegations of homophobia\\nSome of Eminem\\'s lyrics have been criticized for being homophobic, and an Australian politician attempted to ban him from the country. Eminem denies the charge, saying that when he was growing up words such as \"faggot\" and \"queer\" were used generally in a derogatory manner and not specifically toward homosexuals. During a 2010 60 Minutes interview, journalist Anderson Cooper explored the issue:\\n\\nIn 2013, Eminem was accused of homophobia due to the lyrics of the song \"Rap God\", explaining to Rolling Stone, \"I don\\'t know how to say this without saying it how I\\'ve said it a million times. But that word, those kind of words, when I came up battle-rappin\\' or whatever, I never really equated those words ... (to actually mean homosexual)\".\\nIn 2018, Eminem was criticized for using the word \"faggot\" against Tyler, the Creator in the song \"Fall\". Eminem later apologized for using the homophobic slur, saying he went \"too far\". Discussing the issue in a multi-part interview with radio host Sway, Eminem explained that while he meant to stand up for himself, \"I think the word that I called him on that song was one of the things where I felt like, \\'This might be too far.\\'\" He added, \"Because in my quest to hurt him [Tyler], I realize that I was hurting a lot of other people by saying it.\"\\nEminem is a friend of openly gay singer Elton John, and publicly supports gay rights. When asked in an interview with The New York Times about the subject of same-sex marriage being legalized in his home state of Michigan, Eminem responded, \"I think if two people love each other, then what the hell? I think that everyone should have the chance to be equally miserable, if they want\", explaining that his \"overall look on things is a lot more mature than it used to be\".\\n\\nLegacy\\nCredited for popularizing hip hop to a Middle American audience, Eminem\\'s unprecedented global commercial success and acclaimed works for a white rapper is widely recognized for breaking racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. Rising from rags to riches, Eminem\\'s anger-fueled music represented widespread angst and the reality of American underclass. He has been greatly influential for artists of various genres.\\nStephen Hill, the then vice president of African American-themed television network BET (Black Entertainment Television), said in 2002:Eminem gets a pass in the same vein that back during segregation black folks had to be better than average, had to be the best, to be accepted ... he is better than the best. In his own way, he is the best lyricist, alliterator and enunciator out there in hip-hop music. In terms of rapping about the pain that other disenfranchised people feel, there is no one better at their game than Eminem.\\nIn 2002, the BBC said that the perception of Eminem as a \"modern-day William Shakespeare\" was comparable to the reception of American singer Bob Dylan: \"Not since Bob Dylan\\'s heyday in the mid-1960s has an artist\\'s output been subjected to such intense academic scrutiny as an exercise in contemporary soul-searching. US critics point to [Eminem\\'s] vivid portraits of disenfranchised lives—using the stark, direct language of the street—as an accurate reflection of social injustice.\" In addition, the BBC highlighted that, \"Where parents once recoiled in horror [to his music], there now seems a greater willingness to acknowledge a music that is striking such a chord among the American young, angry white underclass.\" Dan Ozzi of Vice highlighted that Eminem during the early 2000s was \"the one artist high school kids seemed to unanimously connect with.... he represented everything high school years are about: blind rage, misguided rebellion, adolescent frustration. He was like a human middle finger. An X-rated Dennis the Menace for a dial-up modem generation.\"\\nWriting for Spin in 2002, rock critic Alan Light compared Eminem to the Beatles\\' John Lennon:\\n\\nEminem is even starting to bear a resemblance to one of those rock icons ... Marshall Mathers is becoming something like this generation\\'s John Lennon ... Lennon and Eminem were both subjects of pickets and protests; they both wrote songs about troubled relationships with their mothers; they both wrote about their strange public lives with their wives; they both wrote about how much they loved their kids. Lennon, of course, was able to find ways to use his voice to advocate for peace rather than just blasting away at litigious family members and various pop stars, but still, few other pop musicians since Lennon have found a way to render their private psychodramas into compelling art as effectively as Eminem.\\nRegarding his rehearsal with Eminem for the \"Stan\" duet at the 2001 Grammy Awards, English singer Elton John said, \"[When] Eminem made his entrance, I got goose bumps, the likes of which I have not felt since I first saw Jimi Hendrix, Mick Jagger, James Brown and Aretha Franklin. Eminem was that good. I just thought, \\'Fuck, this man is amazing\\'. There are very few performers who can grab you like that the first time—only the greats.\" John further praised Eminem, saying, \"Eminem is a true poet of his time, someone we\\'ll be talking about for decades to come. He tells stories in such a powerful and distinctive way. As a lyricist, he\\'s one of the best ever. Eminem does for his audience what [Bob] Dylan did for his: He writes how he feels. His anger, vulnerability and humor come out.\"Concerning the controversy surrounding Eminem due to his transgressive music, American entertainer Madonna had said, \"I like the fact that Eminem is brash and angry and politically incorrect ... He\\'s stirring things up, he\\'s provoking a discussion, he\\'s making people\\'s blood boil. He\\'s reflecting what\\'s going on in society right now. That is what art is supposed to do.\" American musician Stevie Wonder also said, \"Rap to me is a modern blues—a statement of how and where people are at ... I think art is a reflection of our society, and people don\\'t like to confront the realities in society ... But until we really confront the truth, we are going to have a Tupac or Eminem or Biggie Smalls to remind us about it—and thank God. They force people to look at realities in society.\"\\nThe previously mentioned Bob Dylan praised Eminem, along with other artists, in a 2022 interview with the Wall Street Journal.\\nEminem has been credited with boosting the careers of hip hop proteges such as 50 Cent, Yelawolf, Stat Quo, Royce da 5\\'9\", Cashis, Obie Trice, Bobby Creekwater, Boogie and hip hop groups such as D12 and Slaughterhouse. A number of artists have cited Eminem as an influence, including The Weeknd, Usher, Rae Sremmurd, Logic, Joyner Lucas, Lil Wayne, 50 Cent, Kendrick Lamar, Ed Sheeran, J. Cole, Chance the Rapper, Regina Spektor, Lana Del Rey, and Juice WRLD.\\n\\nAchievements and honors\\nWith global sales of over 220 million records, Eminem is one of the best-selling music artists ever. He has had thirteen number-one albums on the Billboard 200: nine solo, two with D12 and one with Bad Meets Evil. He was the bestselling music artist from 2000 to 2009 in the US according to Nielsen SoundScan. He was also the bestselling male music artist in the United States of the 2010s. He has sold 47.4 million albums in the country and 107.5 million singles in the US. The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Curtain Call: The Hits, \"Lose Yourself\", \"Love the Way You Lie\" and \"Not Afraid\" have all been certified Diamond or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Eminem has over ten billion views of his music videos on his YouTube Vevo page, and in 2014 Spotify named him the most-streamed music artist ever.\\nAmong Eminem\\'s awards is 15 Grammy Awards, eight American Music Awards and 17 Billboard Music Awards, Billboard named him the \"Artist of the Decade (2000–2009)\". In 2013, he received the Global Icon Award at that year\\'s MTV Europe Music Awards ceremony. His success in 8 Mile saw him win the 2002 Academy Award for Best Original Song for his song \"Lose Yourself\", co-written with Jeff Bass and Luis Resto, making him the first rapper to receive the award. He also won the MTV Movie & TV Awards for Best Actor in a Movie and Best Breakthrough Performance and the Critics\\' Choice Movie Award for Best Song for \"Lose Yourself\".\\nEminem has also been included and ranked in several publications\\' lists. Rolling Stone included him in its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time. He was ranked 9th on MTV\\'s Greatest MCs of All Time list. He was ranked 13th on MTV\\'s 22 Greatest Voices in Music list and 79th on the VH1 100 Greatest Artists of All Time lists. He was ranked 82nd on Rolling Stone\\'s \"The Immortals\" list. In 2010, MTV Portugal ranked Eminem the 7th biggest icon in popular music history. In 2012, The Source ranked him 6th on their list of the Top 50 Lyricists of All Time, while About.com ranked him 7th on its list of the 50 Greatest MCs of Our Time (1987–2007). In 2015, Eminem was placed third on \"The 10 Best Rappers of All Time\" list by Billboard. In 2008, Vibe readers named Eminem the Best Rapper Alive. In 2011, Eminem was labeled the \"King of Hip-Hop\" by Rolling Stone based on an analysis of album sales, chart positions, YouTube views, social media following, concert grosses, industry awards and critical ratings of solo rappers who released music from 2009 to the first half of 2011.\\nEminem was also inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Class of 2022, alongside Duran Duran and Dolly Parton.\\n\\nLiterary works\\nDiscography\\nStudio albums\\n\\nInfinite (1996)\\nThe Slim Shady LP (1999)\\nThe Marshall Mathers LP (2000)\\nThe Eminem Show (2002)\\nEncore (2004)\\nRelapse (2009)\\nRecovery (2010)\\nThe Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013)\\nRevival (2017)\\nKamikaze (2018)\\nMusic to Be Murdered By (2020)\\nThe Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce) (2024)\\nExtended plays\\n\\nSlim Shady EP (1997)\\nCollaborative albums\\n\\nDevil\\'s Night (with D12) (2001)\\nD12 World (with D12) (2004)\\nEminem Presents: The Re-Up (with Shady Records) (2006)\\nHell: The Sequel (with Bad Meets Evil) (2011)\\nShady XV (with Shady Records) (2014)\\nCollaborative EPs\\n\\nThe Underground E.P.

              "['Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as Eminem (also stylized as EMINƎM), is an American rapper. He is credited with popularizing hip hop in Middle America and is regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time. His global success is considered to have broken racial barriers to the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him a controversial figure, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as influencing many musical artists. His most popular songs include \"My Name Is\", \"The Real Slim Shady\", \"Stan\", \"Without Me\", \"Lose Yourself\", \"Not Afraid\", \"Love the Way You Lie\", \"The Monster\" and \"Houdini\".\\nAfter the release of his debut album Infinite (1996) and the extended play Slim Shady EP (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dre\\'s Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP. His next two releases, The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and The Eminem Show (2002), were worldwide successes and were nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, the latter becoming the best-selling album worldwide of 2002. After the release of his next album, Encore (2004), Eminem went on hiatus, largely due to a prescription drug addiction. He returned to the music industry with the releases of Relapse (2009) and Recovery (2010), the latter becoming the best-selling album worldwide of 2010. He then released the US number-one albums The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013), Revival (2017), Kamikaze (2018), and Music to Be Murdered By (2020). His twelfth studio album, The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce), was released in July 2024.\\nEminem was also a member of the hip hop group D12, and has collaborated with fellow Detroit-based rapper Royce da 5\\'9\" as the duo Bad Meets Evil. Eminem played a dramatized version of himself in the 2002 musical drama film 8 Mile. \"Lose Yourself\", a song from its soundtrack, topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 12 weeks—the most for a solo rap song—and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, making him the first hip hop artist ever to win the award. He also co-founded Shady Records, which helped launch the careers of artists such as D12, 50 Cent, and Obie Trice, and established his own Sirius XM Radio channel, Shade 45.\\nEminem is among the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated worldwide sales of over 220 million records. He was the best-selling music artist in the United States for the 2000s, placing third for the 2010s. He was the first artist to have ten albums consecutively debut at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, and has had five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Curtain Call: The Hits (2005), \"Lose Yourself\", \"Love the Way You Lie\", and \"Not Afraid\" have all been certified Diamond or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). He has won numerous awards, including 15 Grammy Awards, eight American Music Awards, 17 Billboard Music Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, and an MTV Europe Music Global Icon Award. Billboard named him the \"Artist of the Decade (2000–2009)\", and Rolling Stone named him one of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\" and \"100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time\". In 2022, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\\n\\nEarly life\\nMarshall Bruce Mathers III was born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri, the only child of Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr. and Deborah Rae \"Debbie\" (née Nelson). His mother nearly died during her 73-hour labor with him. Eminem\\'s parents were in a band called Daddy Warbucks, playing in Ramada Inns along the Dakotas–Montana border before they separated. His father abandoned his family when Eminem was a year and a half old, and Eminem was raised only by his mother, Debbie, in poverty. He wrote letters to his father, but Debbie said that they all came back marked \"return to sender\". His mother later had a son named Nathan \"Nate\" Kane Samara. \\nBy age of twelve, Eminem and his mother shuttled between states, rarely staying in one house for more than a year or two and mostly living with family members, moved several times and lived in several towns and cities in Missouri (including St. Joseph, Savannah, and Kansas City) and Metro Detroit (Warren and Roseville) before settling in the city of Detroit. For much of his youth, Eminem and his mother lived in a working-class, primarily black, Detroit neighborhood. He and Debbie were one of three white households on their block, and Eminem was beaten several times by black youths.\\nEminem frequently fought with his mother, whom a social worker described as her having a \"very suspicious, almost paranoid personality\". When he was a child, a bully named D\\'Angelo Bailey severely injured Eminem\\'s head in an assault, an incident which Eminem later recounted (with comic exaggeration) on the song \"Brain Damage\". Debbie filed a lawsuit against the public school for this in 1982. The suit was dismissed the following year by a Macomb County, Michigan, judge, who said the schools were immune from lawsuits.\\nEminem was interested in storytelling, aspiring to be a comic book artist before discovering hip hop. He heard his first rap song (\"Reckless\", featuring Ice-T) on the Breakin\\' soundtrack, a gift from Debbie\\'s half-brother, Ronnie Polkingharn. His uncle was close to the boy and later became a musical mentor to him. When Polkingharn committed suicide in 1991, Eminem stopped speaking publicly for days and did not attend his funeral.\\nAt age 14, Eminem began rapping with high-school friend Mike Ruby; they adopted the names \"Manix\" and \"M&M\", the latter evolving into \"Eminem\". Eminem snuck into neighboring Osborn High School with friend and fellow rapper Proof for lunchroom freestyle rap battles. On Saturdays, they attended open mic contests at the Hip-Hop Shop on West 7 Mile Road, considered \"ground zero\" for the Detroit rap scene. Struggling to succeed in a predominantly black industry, Eminem was appreciated by underground hip hop audiences. When he wrote verses, he wanted most of the words to rhyme; he wrote long words or phrases on paper and, underneath, worked on rhymes for each syllable. Although the words often made little sense, the drill helped Eminem practice sounds and rhymes.\\nIn 1987, Debbie allowed runaway Kimberly Anne \"Kim\" Scott to stay at their home. Several years later, Eminem began an on-and-off relationship with Scott. After spending three years in ninth grade due to truancy and poor grades, he dropped out of Lincoln High School at age 17. Although interested in English, Eminem never explored literature (preferring comic books) and he disliked math and social studies. Eminem worked at several jobs to help his mother pay the bills. One of the jobs he had was with Little Caesar\\'s Pizza in Warren. He later said she often threw him out of the house anyway, often after taking most of his paycheck. When she left to play bingo, he would blast the stereo and write songs.\\n\\nMusic career\\n1988–1997: early career, Infinite and family struggles\\nIn 1988, he went by the stage name MC Double M and formed his first group, New Jacks, and made a self-titled demo tape with DJ Butter Fingers. In 1989, they later joined Bassmint Productions who later changed their name to Soul Intent in 1992 with rapper Proof and other childhood friends. They released a self-titled EP in 1995 featuring Proof. Eminem also made his first music video appearance in 1992 in a song titled, \"Do-Da-Dippity\", by Champtown. Later in 1996, Eminem and Proof teamed up with four other rappers to form The Dirty Dozen (D12), who released The Underground E.P. in 1997 and their first album Devil\\'s Night in 2001. He was also affiliated with Newark\\'s rap collective Outsidaz, collaborating with them on different projects.\\nEminem was soon signed to Jeff and Mark Bass\\'s F.B.T. Productions and recorded his debut album Infinite for their independent Web Entertainment label. The album was a commercial failure upon its release in 1996. One lyrical subject of Infinite was his struggle to raise his newborn daughter, Hailie Jade Scott Mathers, on little money. During this period, Eminem\\'s rhyming style, primarily inspired by rappers Nas, Esham and AZ, lacked the comically violent slant for which he later became known. Detroit disc jockeys largely ignored Infinite and the feedback Eminem did receive (\"Why don\\'t you go into rock and roll?\") led him to craft angrier, moodier tracks.\\nAt this time Eminem and Kim Scott lived in a crime-ridden neighborhood and their house was robbed several times. Eminem cooked and washed dishes for minimum wage at Gilbert\\'s Lodge, a family-style restaurant at St. Clair Shores. His former boss described him as becoming a model employee, as he worked 60 hours a week for six months after Hailie\\'s birth. He was fired shortly before Christmas and later said, \"It was, like, five days before Christmas, which is Hailie\\'s birthday. I had, like, forty dollars to get her something.\" After the release of Infinite, his personal problems and substance abuse culminated in a suicide attempt. By March 1997 he was fired from Gilbert\\'s Lodge for the last time and lived in his mother\\'s mobile home with Kim and Hailie.\\n\\n1997–1999: introduction of Slim Shady, The Slim Shady LP and rise to success\\nEminem attracted more attention when he developed Slim Shady, a sadistic, violent alter ego. The character allowed him to express his anger with lyrics about drugs, rape and murder. In the spring of 1997 he recorded his debut EP, the Slim Shady EP, which was released that winter by Web Entertainment. The EP, with frequent references to drug use, sexual acts, mental instability and violence, also explored the more-serious themes of dealing with poverty and marital and family difficulties and revealed his direct, self-deprecating response to criticism. Hip hop magazine The Source featured Eminem in its \"Unsigned Hype\" column in March 1998.\\nAfter he was fired from his job and evicted from his home, Eminem went to Los Angeles to compete in the 1997 Rap Olympics, a nationwide battle rap competition. He placed second, losing to Project Blowed MC Otherwize. An Interscope Records intern named Dean Geistlinger was in attendance and asked Eminem for a copy of the Slim Shady EP, which was then sent to company CEO Jimmy Iovine. Iovine played the tape for record producer Dr. Dre, founder of Aftermath Entertainment and founding member of hip hop group N.W.A. Dre recalled, \"In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, \\'Find him. Now.\\'\" Dre would later state on the fourth and last episode of The Defiant Ones, \"I was like: what the fuck!?, and who the fuck is that?\" expressing his shock towards Mathers\\'s rapping talent. Although his associates criticized him for hiring a white rapper, Dre was confident in his decision: \"I don\\'t give a fuck if you\\'re purple; if you can kick it, I\\'m working with you.\" Eminem had idolized Dre since listening to N.W.A as a teenager and was nervous about working with him on an album: \"I didn\\'t want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much ... I\\'m just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars let alone Dr. Dre.\" He became more comfortable working with Dre after a series of productive recording sessions.\\nEminem released The Slim Shady LP in February 1999. Although it was one of the year\\'s most popular albums (certified triple platinum by the end of the year), he was accused of imitating the style and subject matter of underground rapper Cage. The album\\'s popularity was accompanied by controversy over its lyrics; in \"\\'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" Eminem describes a trip with his infant daughter when he disposes of his wife\\'s body and in \"Guilty Conscience\" which encourages a man to murder his wife and her lover. \"Guilty Conscience\" marked the beginning of a friendship and musical bond between Dr. Dre and Eminem. The label-mates later collaborated on a number of hit songs (\"Forgot About Dre\" and \"What\\'s the Difference\" while also providing uncredited vocals on \"The Watcher\" from Dr. Dre\\'s album 2001, \"Bitch Please II\" from The Marshall Mathers LP, \"Say What You Say\" from The Eminem Show, \"Encore/Curtains Down\" from Encore and \"Old Time\\'s Sake\" and \"Crack a Bottle\" from Relapse) and Dre made at least one guest appearance on each of Eminem\\'s Aftermath albums. The Slim Shady LP has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA.\\n\\n1999–2003: The Marshall Mathers LP and The Eminem Show\\nAfter Eminem released The Slim Shady LP, he started his own record label, Shady Records, in late 1999. Eminem looked for an avenue to release D12, and his manager Paul Rosenberg was keen to start a label, which led to the two teaming up to form Shady. Its A&R Marc Labelle has defined the record label as \"a boutique label but [with] all the outlets of a major [and] Interscope backing up our every move.\"\\nRecorded from 1999 to 2000, The Marshall Mathers LP was released in May 2000. It sold 1.76 million copies in its first week, breaking US records held by Snoop Dogg\\'s Doggystyle for fastest-selling hip hop album and Britney Spears\\' ...Baby One More Time for fastest-selling solo album. The first single from the album, \"The Real Slim Shady\", was a success despite controversies about Eminem\\'s insults and dubious claims about celebrities (for example, that Christina Aguilera had performed oral sex on Carson Daly and Fred Durst). In his second single, \"The Way I Am\", he reveals the pressure from his record company to top \"My Name Is\". Although Eminem parodied shock rocker Marilyn Manson in the music video for \"My Name Is\", they are reportedly on good terms; Manson is mentioned in \"The Way I Am\", appeared in its music video and has performed a live remix of the song with Eminem. In the third single, \"Stan\" (which samples Dido\\'s \"Thank You\"), Eminem tries to deal with his new fame, assuming the persona of a deranged fan who kills himself and his pregnant girlfriend (mirroring \"\\'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" from The Slim Shady LP).\\nThe music magazine Q called \"Stan\" the third-greatest rap song ever, and it was ranked tenth in a Top40-Charts.com survey. The song has since been ranked 296th on Rolling Stone\\'s \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list. In July 2000, Eminem was the first white artist to appear on the cover of The Source. The Marshall Mathers LP was certified Diamond by the RIAA in March 2011 and sold 21 million copies worldwide.\\nIn 2000 Eminem also appeared in the Up in Smoke Tour with rappers Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit and Ice Cube and the Family Values Tour with Limp Bizkit, headlining the Anger Management Tour with Papa Roach, Ludacris and Xzibit. Eminem performed with Elton John at the 43rd Grammy Awards ceremony in 2001, with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD, an organization which considered Eminem\\'s lyrics homophobic) condemning John\\'s decision to perform with Eminem. Entertainment Weekly placed the appearance on its end-of-decade \"best-of\" list: \"It was the hug heard \\'round the world. Eminem, under fire for homophobic lyrics, shared the stage with a gay icon for a performance of \\'Stan\\' that would have been memorable in any context.\" On February 21, the day of the awards ceremony, GLAAD held a protest outside the Staples Center (the ceremony\\'s venue). Eminem was also the only guest artist to appear on fellow rapper Jay-Z\\'s critically acclaimed album The Blueprint, producing and rapping on the song \"Renegade\".\\nThe Eminem Show was released in May 2002. It was another success, reaching number one on the charts and selling over 1.332 million copies during its first full week. The album\\'s single, \"Without Me\", denigrates boy bands, Limp Bizkit, Dick and Lynne Cheney, Moby and others. The Eminem Show, certified Diamond by the RIAA, examines the effects of Eminem\\'s rise to fame, his relationship with his wife and daughter and his status in the hip hop community, addressing an assault charge brought by a bouncer he saw kissing his wife in 2000. Although several tracks are clearly angry, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found The Eminem Show less inflammatory than The Marshall Mathers LP. L. Brent Bozell III, who had criticized The Marshall Mathers LP for misogynistic lyrics, noted The Eminem Show\\'s extensive use of obscenity and called Eminem \"Eminef\" for the prevalence of the word \"motherfucker\" on the album. The Eminem Show sold 27 million copies worldwide and was the bestselling album of 2002.\\n\\n2003–2007: production work, Encore and musical hiatus\\nIn 2003, Eminem, a lifelong fan of Tupac, provided production work for three tracks on the Tupac Resurrection soundtrack. He would follow this up the next year by producing 12 of the 16 tracks on Tupac\\'s Loyal to the Game album. On December 8, 2003, the United States Secret Service said that it was \"looking into\" allegations that Eminem had threatened the President of the United States. The cause for concern was the lyrics of \"We As Americans\" (\"Fuck money / I don\\'t rap for dead presidents / I\\'d rather see the president dead / It\\'s never been said, but I set precedents\"), which was later released on a bonus CD with the deluxe edition of Encore.\\nEncore, released in 2004, was another success, but not as successful as his previous albums. Its sales were partially driven by the first single, \"Just Lose It\", which contained slurs directed toward Michael Jackson. On October 12, 2004, a week after the release of \"Just Lose It\", Jackson phoned Steve Harvey\\'s radio show, The Steve Harvey Morning Show, to report his displeasure with its video (which parodies Jackson\\'s child molestation trial, plastic surgery and the 1984 incident when Jackson\\'s hair caught fire during the filming of a commercial). In the song, Eminem says, \"That\\'s not a stab at Michael / That\\'s just a metaphor / I\\'m just psycho.\" Many of Jackson\\'s friends and supporters spoke out against the video, including Stevie Wonder, who described it as \"kicking a man while he\\'s down\" and \"bullshit\", and Steve Harvey (who said, \"Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back\"). The video also parodied Pee-wee Herman, MC Hammer and Madonna during her Blond Ambition period. \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, who parodied the Eminem song \"Lose Yourself\" on \"Couch Potato\" for his 2003 album Poodle Hat, told the Chicago Sun-Times about Jackson\\'s protest: \"Last year, Eminem forced me to halt production on the video for my \\'Lose Yourself\\' parody because he somehow thought that it would be harmful to his image or career. So the irony of this situation with Michael is not lost on me.\" Although Black Entertainment Television stopped playing the video, MTV announced that it would continue to air it. The Source, through CEO Raymond \"Benzino\" Scott, called for the video to be pulled, the song removed from the album and Eminem to apologize publicly to Jackson. In 2007, Jackson and Sony bought Famous Music from Viacom, giving him the rights to songs by Eminem, Shakira, Beck and others.\\nDespite its lead single\\'s humorous theme, Encore explored serious subject matter with the anti-war song \"Mosh\", which criticized President George W. Bush as \"This weapon of mass destruction that we call our president\", with lyrics including \"Fuck Bush.\" On October 25, 2004, a week before the 2004 US Presidential election, Eminem released the video for \"Mosh\" on the Internet. In it, Eminem gathers an army (including rapper Lloyd Banks) of Bush-administration victims and leads them to the White House. When they break in, it is learned that they are there to register to vote; the video ends with \"VOTE Tuesday November 2.\" After Bush\\'s reelection, the video\\'s ending was changed to Eminem and the protesters invading the White House during a speech by the president. Also in 2004 Eminem launched a satellite music channel, Shade 45, on Sirius radio, which was described by his manager as \"essentially a destination to get and hear things that other people aren\\'t playing.\"\\nEminem began his first US concert tour in three years in the summer of 2005 with the Anger Management 3 Tour, featuring 50 Cent, G-Unit, Lil Jon, D12, Obie Trice and the Alchemist, but in August, Eminem canceled the European leg of the tour, later announcing that he had entered drug rehabilitation for treatment of a \"dependency on sleep medication\". Meanwhile, industry insiders speculated that Eminem was considering retirement, while rumors circulated that a double album titled The Funeral would be released. In July, the Detroit Free Press reported a possible final bow for Eminem as a solo performer, quoting members of his inner circle as saying that he would embrace the roles of producer and label executive. A greatest hits album, Curtain Call: The Hits, was released on December 6, 2005, by Aftermath Entertainment, and sold nearly 441,000 copies in the US in its first week, marking Eminem\\'s fourth consecutive number-one album on the Billboard Hot 200, and was certified double platinum by the RIAA. However, Eminem suggested that month on WKQI\\'s \"Mojo in the Morning\" show that he would be taking a break as an artist: \"I\\'m at a point in my life right now where I feel like I don\\'t know where my career is going ... This is the reason that we called it \\'Curtain Call\\' because this could be the final thing. We don\\'t know.\"\\n\\nIn April 2006, Proof, who was Eminem\\'s childhood friend, was murdered. Eight months later, Eminem released a compilation album titled Eminem Presents: The Re-Up that featured Proof and other Shady Records artists.\\n\\n2007–2009: comeback and Relapse\\nIn September 2007, Eminem called New York radio station WQHT during an interview with 50 Cent, saying that he was \"in limbo\" and \"debating\" about when (or if) he would release another album: \"I\\'m always working—I\\'m always in the studio. It feels good right now, the energy of the label. For a while, I didn\\'t want to go back to the studio ... I went through some personal things. I\\'m coming out of those personal things [and] it feels good.\"\\nEminem appeared on his Shade 45 Sirius channel in September 2008, saying: \"Right now I\\'m kinda just concentrating on my own stuff, for right now and just banging out tracks and producing a lot of stuff. You know, the more I keep producing the better it seems like I get \\'cause I just start knowing stuff.\" Interscope confirmed that a new album would be released in spring 2009. In December 2008, Eminem provided more details about the album, entitled Relapse: \"Me and Dre are back in the lab like the old days, man. Dre will end up producing the majority of the tracks on \\'Relapse\\'. We are up to our old mischievous ways ... let\\'s just leave it at that.\"\\nAccording to a March 5, 2009, press release, Eminem would release two new albums that year. Relapse, the first, was released on May 19; its first single and music video, \"We Made You\", had been released on April 7. Although Relapse did not sell as well as Eminem\\'s previous albums and received mixed reviews, it was a commercial success and re-established his presence in the hip hop world. It sold more than five million copies worldwide. On October 30 he headlined at the Voodoo Experience in New Orleans, his first full performance of the year. Eminem\\'s act included several songs from Relapse, many of his older hits and an appearance by D12. On November 19, he announced on his website that Relapse: Refill would be released on December 21. The album was a re-release of Relapse with seven bonus tracks, including \"Forever\" and \"Taking My Ball\". Eminem described the CD:\\n\\nI want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned ... Hopefully, these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until we put out Relapse 2 next year ... I got back in with Dre and then a few more producers, including Just Blaze, and went in a completely different direction which made me start from scratch. The new tracks started to sound very different than the tracks I originally intended to be on Relapse 2, but I still want the other stuff to be heard.\\n\\n2009–2011: Recovery and Bad Meets Evil reunion\\nOn April 14, 2010, Eminem tweeted: \"There is no Relapse 2\". Although his followers thought he was not releasing an album, he had changed its title to Recovery and confirmed this by tweeting \"Recovery\" with a link to his website. He said:\\n\\nI had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title.\\nRecorded from 2009 to 2010, Recovery was released on June 18. In the US, Recovery sold 741,000 copies during its first week, topping the Billboard 200 chart. Eminem\\'s sixth consecutive US number-one album also topped the charts in several other countries. Recovery remained atop the Billboard 200 chart for five consecutive weeks of a seven-week total.\\nBillboard reported that it was the bestselling album of 2010, making Eminem the first artist in Nielsen SoundScan history with two year-end bestselling albums. Recovery is the bestselling digital album in history. Its first single, \"Not Afraid\", was released on April 29 and debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100; its music video was released on June 4. \"Not Afraid\" was followed by \"Love the Way You Lie\", which debuted at number two before rising to the top. Although \"Love the Way You Lie\" was the bestselling 2010 single in the United Kingdom, it did not reach number one (the first time this has happened in the UK since 1969). Despite criticism of its inconsistency, Recovery received positive reviews from most critics. As of November 21, 2010, the album had US sales of three million copies. Recovery was the bestselling album worldwide in 2010, joining 2002\\'s bestseller The Eminem Show to give Eminem two worldwide year-end number-one albums. With Recovery, Eminem broke the record for the most successive US number-one albums by a solo artist.\\nHe appeared at the 2010 BET Awards, performing \"Not Afraid\" and \"Airplanes, Part II\" with B.o.B and Keyshia Cole. Later that year, he performed at the Activison E3 concert. In June, Eminem and Jay-Z announced they would perform together in Detroit and New York City, at concerts called The Home & Home Tour. The first two concerts quickly sold out, prompting an additional show in each city. BET called Eminem the number-one rapper of the 21st century. He opened the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, performing \"Not Afraid\" and \"Love the Way You Lie\" with Rihanna singing the choruses. Due to the success of Recovery and the Home & Home Tour, Eminem was named the 2010 Hottest MC in the Game by MTV and Emcee of the Year by the online magazine HipHopDX. He and Rihanna again collaborated on \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\", the sequel of their hit single. Unlike the original, Rihanna is the lead vocalist and it is sung from the female perspective. In December 2010, the \"Great Eminem Recovery\" was number one on Billboard\\'s Top 25 Music Moments of 2010. He appeared at the 2011 Grammy Awards on February 13, performing \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\" with Rihanna and Adam Levine and \"I Need a Doctor\" with Dr. Dre and Skylar Grey.

The EP, Hell: The Sequel, was released on June 14, 2011. Eminem was featured on Royce da 5\\'9\"\\'s \"Writer\\'s Block\", released on April 8, 2011. On May 3 they released the lead single \"Fast Lane\" from their upcoming EP and a music video was filmed. In March 2011, within days of each other, The Eminem Show and The Marshall Mathers LP were certified diamond by the RIAA; Eminem is the only rapper with two diamond-certified albums. With more than 60 million \"likes\" he was the most-followed person on Facebook, outscoring Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Rihanna and Michael Jackson. Eminem was the first artist in five years with two number-one albums (Recovery and Hell: The Sequel) in a 12-month period. Early in 2011 he leaked \"2.0 Boys\", on which Yelawolf and Slaughterhouse collaborated when they signed with Shady Records in January and performed it in April.

At the 57th Grammy Awards, he received Best Rap Album award for The Marshall Mathers LP 2 and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration (with Rihanna) for \"The Monster\".\\n\\n2014–2016: Shady XV and Southpaw\\nIn the summer of 2014, Eminem and Rosenberg began using the hashtag #SHADYXV on social networking sites and Eminem wore a T-shirt with the hashtag onstage. This was later revealed to be the name of an upcoming Shady Records compilation. Shortly afterwards the first single from the album (\"Guts Over Fear\", featuring singer-songwriter Sia) was released and the album\\'s track list was released on October 29. Shady Records released a cypher to promote the album, in which Eminem did a seven-minute freestyle. \"Detroit vs. Everybody\" (the album\\'s second single), with Eminem, Dej Loaf, Royce da 5\\'9\", Danny Brown, Big Sean and Trick-Trick, was released on November 11.

In the song, Eminem calls the newly elected President Donald Trump a \"bitch\" and also raps about raping conservative social and political commentator Ann Coulter, who is a Trump supporter, with a variety of foreign objects. Coulter responded to the lyrics, stating, \"I think it\\'s unfortunate that the left, from Berkeley to Eminem with his rap songs, has normalized violence against women, as Eminem has done.\" Eminem participated in the 2017 BET Hip Hop Awards\\' annual cypher, using his verse, a freestyle rap called \"The Storm\", to further criticize Trump and the administration for, among other things, Trump\\'s focus on National Football League players\\' protests during \"The Star Spangled Banner\" over Hurricane Maria recovery efforts and lack of gun control reform in the wake of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. Eminem ended the cypher by giving an ultimatum saying that Trump supporters cannot be his fans. The verse received wide praise among other rappers following its release. In October 2017, Eminem appeared on \"Revenge\", a track from Pink\\'s album Beautiful Trauma. It was reported that the Secret Service interviewed Eminem in 2018–2019, regarding threatening lyrics towards President Trump and daughter Ivanka.\\nStarting in late October 2017, Eminem and Paul Rosenberg began teasing what fans speculated was the title of a new album titled Revival, in the form of advertisements for a fake medication of the same name. Later in November, the first single \"Walk on Water\" was released, which featured Beyoncé. The song was first performed, by Eminem, at the 2017 MTV Europe Music Awards on November 12, featuring Skylar Grey. He appeared on Saturday Night Live on November 18, performing \"Walk on Water\", \"Stan\" and \"Love the Way You Lie\" with Skylar Grey. On November 28, Dr. Dre posted a video confirming the album\\'s release date as December 15, 2017. On December 8, Eminem released a promotional single titled \"Untouchable\", which featured a sample from the duo Cheech & Chong. Despite an online leak of the album two days prior, Revival was released as planned on December 15. On January 5, 2018, the second single \"River\" was released, which featured Ed Sheeran. It became Eminem\\'s eighth consecutive album to top the US Billboard 200 upon release with 197,000 copies sold in its first week. As a result, he became the first musical act to have eight entries in a row debut atop the chart. The album was met with mixed reviews from music critics and is generally considered his worst album. In 2018, an extended edition of \"Nowhere Fast\" with Kehlani and a remix of \"Chloraseptic\" featuring 2 Chainz and Phresher were released from Revival.\\nOn August 31, 2018, Eminem released his tenth studio album and first surprise album Kamikaze, making it his second full-length studio album in 8 months. The album topped the Billboard 200, making it his ninth album in a row to do so, after selling 434,000 units in the first week. The album was released as a response to criticism of Revival, his worst rated album. The album was promoted with three singles: \"Fall\", \"Venom\" from the 2018 film of the same name, and \"Lucky You\".

Subsequently, Eminem became the first artist to have ten consecutive albums debut at number one in the US and one of six artists to have released at least ten US number-one albums. Music critics praised Eminem\\'s lyrical abilities and the improved production after Kamikaze, while criticism directed towards the album\\'s formulaic song structure, lack of innovation and shock value.\\nThe lyrics of \"Unaccommodating\", in which Eminem referenced the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, drew significant criticism, with many critics finding the lyrics objectionable. The mayor of Manchester denounced the song\\'s lyrics, describing them as \"unnecessarily hurtful and deeply disrespectful\". The lyrics also drew widespread criticism from victims\\' relatives and others involved in the attack. On February 9, 2020, Mathers performed \"Lose Yourself\" at the 92nd Academy Awards. On March 9, 2020, the music video for the song \"Godzilla\" was released on YouTube through Lyrical Lemonade\\'s channel. The video features Mike Tyson and Dr. Dre.

The song features disses aimed at Benzino, who has had a long-time beef with Eminem, with lines like \"I have a riddle, one condition you mustn\\'t laugh. What is the opposite of Benzino? A giraffe\". The disses are a response to Benzino\\'s track \"Rap Elvis\".\\nDuring an episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! on March 19, 2024, Dr. Dre stated that Eminem intended to release a new album that year. On April 25, Eminem appeared alongside Roger Goodell at the opening ceremony of the 2024 NFL draft in Detroit. At the same time, Eminem announced a twelfth studio album titled The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce), with a planned release later in the year. The trailer for the album, which was shown on the NFL Network, briefly discusses the \"murder\" of the Slim Shady persona in a true crime format. 50 Cent is also featured in a cameo role. The album is produced by Dr. Dre and The ICU.\\nOn May 28, 2024, the rapper posted a joint Instagram video with magician David Blaine. The video shows a video call between Eminem and Blaine, with the former asking for help and a magic trick to which the latter responds by eating a glass of wine. The rapper then previews the track \"Houdini\" by playing a short instrumental snippet. At the end of the clip, the song title and release date are revealed. It was released on May 31, 2024, as the lead single. It topped the charts in many countries, as well as debuting at number 1 on the Billboard Global 200 and number 2 on the Hot 100.\\nOn June 28, 2024, Eminem posted a teaser for the album\\'s second single, titled \"Tobey\" and featuring fellow Detroit rappers Big Sean and BabyTron. The short black-and-white clip depicted the rapper wearing a Jason mask and wielding a chainsaw while standing next to the featured artists, with an instrumental snippet playing in the background. The song released on July 2, with an accompanying music video produced by Cole Bennett to follow on July 5. The track title is a reference to actor Tobey Maguire, best known for his role in the Spider-Man films. The single art is also a reference to the iconic \"3 spiderman pointing\" meme.\\n\\nArtistry\\nInfluences, style and rapping technique\\nEminem has cited several MCs as influencing his rapping style, including Esham, Kool G Rap, Masta Ace, Big Daddy Kane, Tupac Shakur, Newcleus, Ice-T, Mantronix, Melle Mel (on \"The Message\"), LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, Run-D.M.C., Rakim and Boogie Down Productions.\\nIn How to Rap, Guerilla Black notes that Eminem studied other MCs to hone his rapping technique: \"Eminem listened to everything and that\\'s what made him one of the greats\". In the book, other MCs also praise aspects of his rapping technique: varied, humorous subject matter, connecting with his audience, carrying a concept over a series of albums, complex rhyme schemes, bending words so they rhyme, multisyllabic rhymes, many rhymes to a bar, complex rhythms, clear enunciation, and the use of melody and syncopation. Eminem is known to write most of his lyrics on paper (documented in The Way I Am), taking several days or a week to craft lyrics, being a \"workaholic\" and \"stacking\" vocals. Examples of hip hop subgenres that Eminem\\'s music has been described as include horrorcore, comedy hip hop, and hardcore hip hop. Eminem also incorporates rap rock into his music and has cited rock acts during the 1970s and 1980s, such as Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin, as influences in his music.\\n\\nAlter egos\\nEminem uses alter egos in his songs for different rapping styles and subject matter. His best-known alter ego, Slim Shady, first appeared on the Slim Shady EP and was in The Slim Shady LP, The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Encore, Relapse, The Marshall Mathers LP 2, Kamikaze and Music to Be Murdered By. In this persona, his songs are violent and dark, with a comic twist. Eminem downplayed Slim Shady on Recovery because he felt it did not fit the album\\'s theme. The end of the character is suggested to be with The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce) LP in 2024.\\nAnother character is Ken Kaniff, a gay man who pokes fun at Eminem\\'s songs. Ken was created and originally played by fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle on the Slim Shady LP, where Kaniff makes a prank call to Eminem. An argument after the album\\'s release prompted Eminem to use the Kaniff character on Marshall Mathers and later albums (except Encore and Recovery). Aristotle, angry with Eminem\\'s use of his character, released a mixtape in his Kaniff persona ridiculing him.\\n\\nCollaborations and productions\\nAlthough Eminem usually collaborates with Aftermath Entertainment and Shady Records rappers such as Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, D12, Obie Trice and Yelawolf, he has also worked with Redman, Kid Rock, DMX, Lil Wayne, Missy Elliott, Jay Z, Drake, Rihanna, Nas, Nicki Minaj, Xzibit, Method Man, Jadakiss, Fat Joe, Sticky Fingaz, T.I. and Young Jeezy. Eminem rapped a verse in a live performance of Busta Rhymes\\' \"Touch It\" remix at the 2006 BET Music Awards. He appeared on Akon\\'s single \"Smack That\" from Konvicted, Lil Wayne\\'s hit \"Drop the World\" and \"My Life\" (the lead single from 50 Cent\\'s Street King Immortal).\\nEminem was the executive producer of D12\\'s first two albums (Devil\\'s Night and D12 World), Obie Trice\\'s Cheers and Second Round\\'s on Me and 50 Cent\\'s Get Rich or Die Tryin\\' and The Massacre. He has produced songs for other rappers such as Jadakiss\\' \"Welcome To D-Block\", Jay-Z\\'s \"Renegade\" and \"Moment of Clarity\", Lloyd Banks\\' \"On Fire\", \"Warrior Part 2\" and \"Hands Up\", Tony Yayo\\'s \"Drama Setter\", Trick-Trick\\'s \"Welcome 2 Detroit\" and Xzibit\\'s \"My Name\" and \"Don\\'t Approach Me\". Most of The Eminem Show was produced by Eminem and his longtime collaborator, Jeff Bass, and Eminem co-produced Encore with Dr. Dre. In 2004, Eminem was co-executive producer of 2Pac\\'s posthumous album Loyal to the Game with Shakur\\'s mother, Afeni. He produced the UK number-one single \"Ghetto Gospel\", featuring Elton John; \"The Cross\", from the Nas album God\\'s Son; and eight tracks on Obie Trice\\'s 2006 album Second Round\\'s on Me (also appearing on \"There They Go\"). Eminem produced several tracks on Trick-Trick\\'s The Villain (appearing on \"Who Want It\") and produced four tracks on Cashis\\' 2013 album The County Hound 2.\\nEminem has only produced for and appeared on one track with former Aftermath/Interscope labelmate The Game; \"We Ain\\'t\" (a track from Game\\'s January 2005 debut album, The Documentary). In 2022, Game would later release a ten-minute diss track towards Eminem titled \"The Black Slim Shady\".\\nEminem is considered unusual in structuring his songs around the lyrics, rather than writing to beats. One exception was \"Stan\", which came from an idea and scratch track produced by the 45 King. After doing little production on Relapse and Recovery, Eminem produced a significant portion of The Marshall Mathers LP 2. He said about producing his own music, \"Sometimes, I may get something in my head, like an idea or the mood of something that I would want, and I\\'m not always gonna get that by going through different tracks that other people have made. They don\\'t know what\\'s in my head. I think maybe it helps, a little bit, with diversity, the sound of it, but also, I would get something in my head and want to be able to lay down that idea from scratch.\" In 1998 when his beef with rapper Cage was still happening, New York rapper Necro (who had previously produced three songs for Cage) met Eminem and gave him a CD with the beat to what eventually became the beat for the song \"Black Helicopters\" by rap group Non-Phixion. Despite Eminem never using it, Necro still said positive things about Eminem and would appear on Shade45 years later.\\n\\nComparisons with other artists\\nAs a white performer prominent in a genre influenced by black artists, Eminem has been compared, much to his chagrin, to Elvis Presley, and has lyrically been compared to Bob Dylan. Rapper Asher Roth has been compared to Eminem and Roth devoted a song on his album (\"As I Em\") to him, which Eminem took offense to. The accomplished trumpeter Nicholas Payton has called Eminem \"the Bix Beiderbecke of hip hop\".\\n\\nOther ventures\\nShady Records\\nFollowing Eminem\\'s multiplatinum record sales, Interscope offered him his own label; he and Paul Rosenberg founded Shady Records in late 1999. Eminem signed his Detroit collective, D12 and rapper Obie Trice to the label and signed 50 Cent in a 2002 joint venture with Dr. Dre\\'s Aftermath label. In 2003, Eminem and Dr. Dre added Atlanta rapper Stat Quo to the Shady-Aftermath roster. DJ Green Lantern, Eminem\\'s former DJ, was with Shady Records until a dispute related to the 50 Cent-Jadakiss feud forced him to leave the label. The Alchemist is currently Eminem\\'s tour DJ. In 2005 Eminem signed another Atlanta rapper, Bobby Creekwater and West Coast rapper Cashis to Shady Records.\\nOn December 5, 2006, the compilation album Eminem Presents: The Re-Up was released on Shady Records. The project began as a mixtape, but when Eminem found the material better than expected he released it as an album. The Re-Up was intended to introduce Stat Quo, Cashis and Bobby Creekwater. While he was recording Infinite, Eminem, Proof and Kon Artis assembled a group of fellow rappers now known as D12, short for \"Detroit Twelve\" or \"Dirty Dozen\", who performed in a style similar to Wu-Tang Clan. In 2001 D12\\'s debut album, Devil\\'s Night, was released. The first single from the album was \"Shit on You\", followed by \"Purple Pills\" (an ode to recreational drug use) and \"Fight Music\". \"Purple Pills\" was rewritten for radio and television, removing many of the song\\'s references to drugs and sex and renamed \"Purple Hills\".\\nAfter their debut, D12 took a three-year break from the studio. They reunited in 2004 for their second album, D12 World, which included the hit singles \"My Band\" and \"How Come\". \"American Psycho 2\" featuring Cypress Hill member, B-Real, was another popular hit. According to D12 member Bizarre, Eminem was not featured on his album Blue Cheese & Coney Island because \"he\\'s busy doing his thing\".\\nIn January 2014, Bass Brothers announced that D12 had returned to record at F.B.T. Studio and they were working on an album with Eminem on at least three songs. Bizarre reported that he was still part of the group and that the album was scheduled for a 2014 release.\\n\\nShade 45\\nEminem established his own satellite radio channel, Shade 45, that plays uncut hip hop. Eminem also established a new morning show, Sway in the Morning with Sway Calloway, a lively morning show that airs at 8:00 a.m., Monday–Friday.\\nEminem promoted the station in a 2004 mock national convention (the \"Shady National Convention\") at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City, in which Donald Trump endorsed him. On his album Revival (2017), Eminem expressed his regret at having collaborated with Trump, rapping, \"wish I would have spit on it before I went to shake his hand at the event\".\\n\\nMom\\'s Spaghetti Restaurant\\nOn September 29, 2021, Eminem and Union Joints opened a spaghetti restaurant at 2131 Woodward Ave in Detroit. It is a reference to the lyrics \"His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy / There\\'s vomit on his sweater already, mom\\'s spaghetti\" from the song \"Lose Yourself\" which became an internet meme. Mom\\'s Spaghetti was previously a pop-up in Detroit in 2017 and at Coachella in 2018.\\nIn 2023, Eminem announced the launch of a \"Mom\\'s Spaghetti\" jarred pasta sauce.\\n\\nActing career\\nAfter small roles in the 2001 film The Wash and as an extra in the 1998 Korn music video for \"Got the Life\" (during which he gave the band a demo tape), Eminem made his Hollywood debut in the semi-autobiographical 2002 film 8 Mile. He said it was a representation of growing up in Detroit rather than an account of his life. He recorded several new songs for the soundtrack, including \"Lose Yourself\" (which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2003 and became the longest-running No. 1 hip hop single in history). Eminem was absent from the ceremony and co-composer Luis Resto accepted the award.\\nEminem voiced an aging, corrupt, AAVE-speaking police officer in the video game 50 Cent: Bulletproof and guested on the Comedy Central television show Crank Yankers and a Web cartoon, The Slim Shady Show He was signed to star in an unmade film version of Have Gun – Will Travel, and was considered for the role of David Rice in the 2008 film Jumper. Eminem had a cameo appearance, arguing with Ray Romano, in the 2009 film Funny People. In a 2010 interview with Jonathan Ross, he stated \"You know, I love music so much. This is my passion, this is what I want to do. Not saying that I won\\'t do a movie ever again, but this is me.\"\\nHe played himself in the Entourage season-seven finale \"Lose Yourself\" with Christina Aguilera. Although Eminem was offered the lead role in the 2013 science-fiction film Elysium, he turned it down because director Neill Blomkamp would not change its location from Los Angeles to Detroit. Eminem had a cameo appearance as himself in the 2014 film The Interview. During an interview with the main character, Dave Skylark (James Franco), Eminem satirically comes out as gay.\\n\\nCharity work\\nEminem established the Marshall Mathers Foundation to aid disadvantaged youth. The foundation works in conjunction with a charity founded by Norman Yatooma, a Detroit attorney. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Eminem donated a pair of Air Jordan 4 Retro Eminem Carhartt shoes, which are rare, to be raffled off with proceeds going to COVID-19 relief. That same year, he donated \"mom\\'s spaghetti\", a reference to a line in his song \"Lose Yourself\", to healthcare workers at Henry Ford Health System in Detroit.\\n\\nAdvertising\\nEminem appeared in two commercials which were shown during Super Bowl XLV. In the first, a one-minute spot for Lipton\\'s Brisk iced tea, he is a claymation figure. In the second, a two-minute ad—the longest in Super Bowl history at the time—for the Chrysler 200, Eminem drives through Detroit (with \"Lose Yourself\" as the soundtrack) to his show at the Fox Theatre.\\n\\nBooks and memoirs\\nOn November 21, 2000, Eminem published Angry Blonde, a non-fiction book featuring a commentary of several of his own songs, along with several previously unpublished photographs.\\nOn October 21, 2008, his autobiography The Way I Am was published. The book was first published on October 21, 2008, by Dutton Adult. It is a collection of Eminem\\'s personal stories, reflections, photographs, original artwork, and original lyric sheets from \"Stan\" and \"The Real Slim Shady\". It details his struggles with poverty, drugs, fame, heartbreak, family and depression, along with stories about his rise to fame and commentary on past controversies. The book is illustrated with never before published photos of Eminem\\'s life. It also contains original drawings, previously unpublished lyric sheets, and other rare memorabilia. The autobiography is named after his 2000 song \"The Way I Am\".\\nAn autobiography of Eminem\\'s mother (My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem) was published the following month, in which Debbie Nelson describes her childhood and adolescence, meeting Eminem\\'s father and her son\\'s rise to (and struggles with) fame.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nFamily and relationships\\nHe was twice married to Kimberly Anne Scott; he met Scott in high school while he stood on a table with his shirt off rapping LL Cool J\\'s \"I\\'m Bad\". Scott and her twin sister had run away from home; they moved in with Eminem and his mother when he was 15 and he began an on-and-off relationship with Scott in January 14, 1991. Their daughter Hailie Jade, who is Mathers\\'s only biological child, was born on December 25, 1995.\\nMathers and Scott were married in June 14, 1999, and divorced in October 12, 2001. Although Eminem told Rolling Stone in 2002, \"I would rather have a baby through my penis than get married again\", he and Scott briefly remarried in January 14, 2006. He filed for divorce in early April, agreeing to joint custody of Hailie and finalize divorce  on December 18, 2006 In early 2010, Eminem denied tabloid reports that he and Scott had renewed their romantic relationship; however, in the same statement, his representative also confirmed that they now maintain a friendly relationship.\\nTheir daughter, Hailie, is a social media influencer, specifically for fashion and beauty. She married her long-term partner Evan McClintock on May 20, 2024, with Eminem, Dr. Dre and 50 Cent among those in attendance.\\nEminem legally adopted and was given custody of his sister-in-law\\'s daughter Alaina Marie, as well as Scott\\'s child from an affair, Stevie Laine. He also raised his younger half-brother Nathan.\\nEminem and actress Brittany Murphy dated in the 2000s. He stated in 2002 that he had been dating singer Mariah Carey, though she later denied it. In 2005, he played alleged voicemails of her during the Anger Management Tour and stated in 2006 that he had dated her for six to seven months, but the two broke up due to the differences in their personalities.\\nIn his 2013 song \"Headlights\", Eminem reiterated his love for his mother and apologized to her for some of the lyrics from his songs, with \"Cleanin\\' Out My Closet\" being specifically named.\\n\\nHealth problems\\nEminem has spoken publicly about his addiction to prescription drugs, including Vicodin, Ambien and Valium. According to friend and fellow D12 member Proof, Eminem first straightened out in 2002. During the production of 8 Mile, Eminem, working 16 hours a day, developed insomnia. An associate gave him an Ambien tablet which \"knocked [him] out\", encouraging him to obtain a prescription. This was Eminem\\'s first experience of drug addiction, which would affect him for several years. Near the end of production on Encore, he would \"just go into the studio and goof off [with] a pocketful of pills\". Eminem began taking the drugs to \"feel normal\", taking a \"ridiculous amount ... I could consume anywhere from 40 to 60 Valium [in a day]. Vicodin, maybe 30.\" The drugs would put him to sleep for no more than two hours, after which he would take more. Eminem\\'s weight increased to 230 pounds (100 kg) and he was regularly eating fast food: \"The kids behind the counter knew me—it wouldn\\'t even faze them. Or I\\'d sit up at Denny\\'s or Big Boy and just eat by myself. It was sad.\" Eminem became less recognizable due to his weight gain and once overheard two teenagers arguing about whether or not it was him: \"Eminem ain\\'t fat.\"\\n\\nIn December 2007, Eminem was hospitalized after a methadone overdose. He had first bought from a dealer who had told him it was \"just like Vicodin, and easier on [your] liver\". He continued to buy more until he collapsed in his bathroom one night and was rushed to the hospital. Doctors there told him he had ingested the equivalent of four bags of heroin and was \"about two hours from dying\". After missing Christmas with his children, Hailie, Alaina and Stevie, Eminem checked himself out of the facility, weak and not fully detoxed. He tore the meniscus in his knee after falling asleep on his sofa, requiring surgery; after he returned home, he had a seizure. His drug use \"ramped right back to where it was before\" within a month. Eminem began to attend church meetings to get clean, but after he was asked for autographs he sought help from a rehabilitation counselor. He began an exercise program that emphasized running. Elton John was a mentor during this period, calling Eminem once a week to check on him. Eminem has been sober since April 20, 2008.\\n\\nThreats\\nIn April 2020, Matthew David Hughes, a 26-year-old homeless man, broke into Eminem\\'s house in Clinton Township, Macomb County, Michigan, breaking a kitchen window with a brick paver. Eminem woke up with Hughes standing behind him and Hughes said that he was there to kill Eminem. In a plea agreement in 2021, Hughes pleaded guilty to second-degree home invasion in exchange for dismissal of other charges; he was sentenced to probation and time served (524 days in the county jail). In 2019, Hughes had pleaded guilty to breaking into a Rochester Hills home in search of Eminem.\\nOn August 30, 2023, it was revealed that the perpetrator of the 2023 Jacksonville shooting Ryan Palmeter targeted Eminem and Machine Gun Kelly as his victims in a racially-motivated attack.\\n\\nPolitics\\nIn multiple songs, Eminem has expressed political views that align with the Democratic Party; however, he has refrained from direct endorsements of politicians, focusing more on criticisms instead. The first was \"Mosh\", which was released in 2004, a few weeks before the 2004 United States presidential election, and heavily criticized then-president George W. Bush but did not directly endorse John Kerry either. Eminem would not express political views again until the 2016 United States presidential election when he released \"Campaign Speech\", which criticized presidential candidate Donald Trump. The following year, Eminem criticized Trump in a freestyle titled \"The Storm\". In the freestyle, Eminem expressed support for former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and the U.S. national anthem protests, and expressed his displeasure for any of his fans that support Trump. In his song \"Darkness\", Eminem heavily references the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting, and at the end of the music video expresses his support for gun control. The week before the 2020 United States presidential election, Eminem approved his song \"Lose Yourself\" to be used in a campaign video for Joe Biden. After the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Eminem posted a tweet to his Twitter expressing his displeasure for the decision saying \"As a father it pisses me off that women have fewer rights 2day than just a few days ago… we r fuckin goin bckwards. Here\\'s how 2 help in Michigan. [sic]\" and included a link to a pro-choice organization in Michigan. In 2023, he requested that Republican election candidate Vivek Ramaswamy stop rapping his song \"Lose Yourself\" at campaign rallies, sending Ramaswamy a cease and desist letter.\\n\\nFaith and beliefs\\nEminem is a Christian, and has rapped about his faith in a few songs, most notably on the remix to \"Use This Gospel\".\\n\\nInterests\\nEminem is a fan of the Detroit Lions and Detroit Pistons.\\n\\nFeuds\\nEminem has had lyrical feuds during his career with many recording artists, including Christina Aguilera, Machine Gun Kelly, Everlast, Cage, Insane Clown Posse, Will Smith, Miilkbone, Mariah Carey, Nick Cannon, Limp Bizkit, Benzino, Ja Rule, Vanilla Ice, Canibus, Jermaine Dupri, Joe Budden, Lord Jamar, and Charlamagne tha God.\\n\\nInsane Clown Posse\\nThe feud with fellow Detroit hip hop duo Insane Clown Posse began in 1997, when Eminem was throwing a party to promote his debut EP, Slim Shady EP. He gave Joseph Bruce (aka Violent J from Insane Clown Posse) a flyer which stated \"Featuring appearances by Esham, Kid Rock, and ICP (maybe)\". Bruce asked why Eminem was promoting a possible Insane Clown Posse appearance without first contacting the group. Eminem explained, \"It says \\'maybe.\\' Maybe you will be there; I don\\'t know. That\\'s why I\\'m asking you right now. You guys comin\\' to my release party, or what?\". Bruce, upset over not being consulted, responded, \"Fuck no, I ain\\'t coming to your party. We might have, if you would\\'ve asked us first, before putting us on the fuckin\\' flyer like this.\"\\nEminem took Bruce\\'s response as a personal offense, subsequently attacking the group in radio interviews. Bruce and Utsler responded with a parody of Eminem\\'s \"My Name Is\" entitled \"Slim Anus\" and other tracks including \"Nuttin\\' But a Bitch Thang\" and \"Please Don\\'t Hate Me\". Eminem insulted Insane Clown Posse on various tracks from his album The Marshall Mathers LP (2000), including \"Marshall Mathers\" and \"Ken Kaniff\". In 2002, Eminem briefly dissed them on his single \"Business\" from The Eminem Show.\\nInsane Clown Posse talked about the feud being squashed in an interview with MTV, saying that Proof squashed the conflict in 2005, which was followed by a bowling game between members of D12 and Psychopathic Records. Violent J stated that, \"He contacted us and we had a bowling game—it was really cool. We\\'re something different. They could have skipped over us and said forget them, but they included us and said let\\'s squash it.\"\\n\\nEverlast and Limp Bizkit\\nIn the early 2000s, Eminem was notified while on the Anger Management Tour that former House of Pain member Everlast had mocked him on a song. Everlast claimed that while passing by Mathers in a hotel lobby, Mathers gave him a \"weird look\". Everlast\\'s verse from the Dilated Peoples all star track \"Ear Drums Pop (Remix)\" contained a thinly veiled reference to Eminem (\"Cock my hammer, spit a comet like Haley/I buck a .380 on ones that act shady\") and went on to warn \"You might catch a beatdown out where I come from\" in his recounting of the incident. Taking offense to this, Eminem and D12 quickly began work on a retaliatory song, \"I Remember\", which ripped Everlast several times in public and with the song.\\nEminem and his group D12 responded with \"Quitter\", the second half of which is a take off on 2Pac\\'s iconic disstrack \"Hit \\'Em Up\" (a diss song aimed at The Notorious B.I.G.). The track ends with the spoken words, \"Fuck him, that\\'s it, I\\'m done, I promise, I\\'m done, that\\'s it.\"\\nIt was reported that long-time friends of Eminem, nu metal group Limp Bizkit, were meant to be featured on the song, but lead singer Fred Durst canceled at the last moment. The record continued to be released without the group, causing the Everlast-Mathers dispute to continue. In a TRL interview, Limp Bizkit member DJ Lethal, made a statement that if Mathers and Everlast were to fight in real life, Everlast would win. This would lead to an insulting track aimed at both Everlast and Limp Bizkit (namely Durst and Lethal) appearing on D12\\'s 2001 mainstream debut album, Devil\\'s Night, as the track \"Girls\".\\nRecently, things seem to have settled and Eminem has no longer been heard insulting Everlast or Limp Bizkit. It is currently unknown if the dispute is resolved. During Eminem\\'s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction speech in 2022, he credited House of Pain as an influence.\\n\\nCanibus\\nThe animus with rapper Canibus started when Canibus and Haitian musician Wyclef Jean confronted Eminem and asked him if he had ghost-wrote the track \"The Ripper Strikes Back\" by LL Cool J. Eminem denied that he wrote the track. After he was confronted, Eminem said Canibus was \"rude\" to him.\\nTwo years later, Canibus went to see Eminem on the Warped Tour and apologized to him for his reactions and asked him if he still wanted the track. Eminem agreed, but when he heard the track \"Phuck U\" from Canibus\\' album 2000 B.C., he thought the track was directed at him and LL Cool J. Shortly afterwards, Eminem released his third album The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and Canibus decided to continue the \"story\" of Eminem\\'s single \"Stan\". He titled the track \"U Didn\\'t Care\" and it continued to take shots at Eminem. Eminem decided to take more shots at Canibus on his album The Eminem Show (2002) on tracks such as \"Say What You Say\", \"When The Music Stops\" and \"Square Dance\". Even though Canibus did not immediately respond to the tracks, Eminem continued to take shots at him, including \"My Name\", a track that Eminem was featured on Xzibit\\'s album Man vs. Machine (2002).\\nOn November 19, 2002, Canibus responded with the track titled \"Dr.\\u200dC PhD\". Over a year later Eminem released the track \"Can-I-Bitch\". He attacked Canibus in a humorous matter. Since then the hostilities have cooled down, but Canibus tried to provoke a reignition of it when he leaked a track titled \"Air Strike (Pop Killer)\", that featured vocal parts of D12, where Canibus takes shots at Eminem and his deceased friend Proof. D12 member Swift responded to the record publicly and had the following to say about DZK (another rapper featured on the track). \"[He] asked us to do a track with him when he already was teamed up with Canibus without us knowing. They dissed Em, took our verses, and added them to the song, so they can bring traffic and make it seem like we were turning on Em [...] as a desperate attempt to be heard after ducking and dodging Em for 7 years. It was a straight hoe move.\"\\n\\nMichael Jackson\\nThe 2004 music video for \"Just Lose It\" generated controversy by parodying pop icon Michael Jackson\\'s child molestation trial, plastic surgery and an incident in which Jackson\\'s hair caught on fire while filming a Pepsi commercial in 1984. It was banned on the BET channel, after complaints from Benzino and others (but was later reinstated, as critics of the ban argued that Nelly\\'s \"Tip Drill\" video could be seen). Both were only seen on BET: Uncut. However, MTV did not drop it, and the video became one of the most requested on the channel. A week after the release of \"Just Lose It\", Jackson called in to the radio show of Steve Harvey to report his displeasure with the video. \"I am very angry at Eminem\\'s depiction of me in his video\", Jackson said in the interview. \"I feel that it is outrageous and disrespectful. It is one thing to spoof, but it is another to be demeaning and insensitive.\" The singer continued: \"I\\'ve admired Eminem as an artist, and was shocked by this. The video was inappropriate and disrespectful to me, my children, my family and the community at large.\" Many of Jackson\\'s supporters and friends spoke out about the video, including Stevie Wonder, who called the video \"kicking a man while he\\'s down\" and \"bullshit\", and Steve Harvey, who declared, \"Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back.\"\\n\\nJa Rule\\nEminem\\'s conflict with rapper Ja Rule started after 50 Cent signed to Shady Records and Aftermath. Ja Rule stated that he had a problem with Eminem and Dr. Dre of signing someone he had conflict with.\\nOn November 19, Ja Rule and Irv Gotti were special guests on Star and Bucwild\\'s morning show on Hot 97 NYC. Gotti claimed to have \"legal documents\" referring to an order of protection 50 Cent \"has on him\". Ja Rule threatened, that if 50 Cent released any diss track, he would take action towards his two producers.\\nHowever, Dr. Dre was the one who produced 50 Cent\\'s track \"Back Down\" in 2003 from the album Get Rich Or Die Tryin\\', which included lyrics insulting not only Murder Inc., but also Ja Rule\\'s family including his then-two-year-old son and seven-year-old daughter Britney Atkins as in the song, 50 Cent raps, \"Your Mami, your Papi, that bitch you chasin\\' your lil dirty ass kids, I\\'ll fuckin\\' erase them.\"\\nFellow rapper Busta Rhymes decided to join the conflict when he was featured on the track \"Hail Mary 2003\", with Eminem and 50 Cent.\\nThe feud intensified when Ja Rule released a diss called \"Loose Change\", in which he took shots at 50 Cent as well as Eminem (calling him \"Feminem\") and Dr. Dre (accuse him of being \"bisexual\" and having a fetish for transvestites – \"bringing transvestites home\"). It includes also the lyrics insulting Eminem\\'s family, including his then-seven-year-old daughter Hailie Jade: \"Em you claim your mother\\'s a crack head and Kim is a known slut, so what\\'s Hailie gonna be when she grows up?\". Eminem, along with D12 and Obie Trice, responded with the track \"Doe Rae Me\" (aka \"Hailie\\'s Revenge\"). Since then, the rift has allegedly cooled down.\\n\\nBenzino and The Source magazine\\nIn 2003, rapper and The Source co-owner Benzino released a diss single titled \"Pull Your Skirt Up\" which took aim at Eminem. The track attacked Eminem\\'s \"street cred\" and accused him of being a tool of the music industry. Eminem had been discovered by The Source after writer Rigo Morales featured him in the magazine\\'s famed monthly \"Unsigned Hype\" column.\\nIn the same year, The Source released an article written by Kimberly Osorio, which identified and researched the history of an old demo tape that the magazine discovered where Eminem insulted Black women and used the word \"nigger\". The demo featured a song called \"Foolish Pride\", recorded in the late 1980s when Eminem claimed to have been \"dumped\" by his African-American then-girlfriend. Eminem responded with two tracks titled \"Nail in the Coffin\" and \"The Sauce\". Benzino would later release more tracks. As a result of the conflict, Shady/Aftermath ads were pulled from the magazine. XXL, another hip hop magazine which had featured negative coverage of Shady/Aftermath artists since Eminem mocked them in his song \"Marshall Mathers\" from his 2000 album The Marshall Mathers LP, stepped in to fill the void, accepting Shady/Aftermath ads.\\nIn January 2024, Eminem reignited the feud with Benzino on a new diss track called \"Doomsday Pt. 2\".\\n\\nMariah Carey and Nick Cannon\\nEminem has written several songs referring to a relationship with R&B singer Mariah Carey, although she denies that they were ever intimate. Eminem has referenced her on many songs, including \"When the Music Stops\", \"Superman\", \"Jimmy Crack Corn\", \"Bagpipes from Baghdad\" and \"The Warning\". While \"Superman\" was released in 2003, Carey released a song entitled \"Clown\" on her album Charmbracelet, released in 2002, which makes similar references in line with her 2009 hit \"Obsessed\".\\nEminem\\'s \"Bagpipes from Baghdad\" from his album Relapse disparages Carey and rapper/then-husband Nick Cannon\\'s relationship. Cannon responded to Eminem by saying his career is based on \"racist bigotry\" and that he would get revenge on Eminem, joking that he may return to rapping. Eminem later stated that the couple misinterpreted the track and it was wishing the two the best. Cannon also stated that there were no hard feelings and that he just had to express his feelings about the song.\\nIn 2009, Carey released \"Obsessed\", about an obsessed man who claims to have been in a relationship with her. Cannon claimed that the song was not an insult directed at Eminem. However, Eminem responded in late July 2009 by releasing a track titled \"The Warning\". It contained samples of voice mail recordings which Eminem claimed were left by Carey, when the two were dating. Eminem also hinted that he had other evidence of their relationship in his possession. A little over a year later in September 2010, Cannon responded with the song \"I\\'m a Slick Rick\", making fun of Eminem.\\n\\nMoby\\nAfter the release of Eminem\\'s 2000 album The Marshall Mathers LP, popular electronic music artist Moby began speaking out against the album\\'s lyrics, citing references to misogyny and homophobia as unacceptable. Eminem responded back with insulting Moby in \"Without Me\", the lead single off his next album The Eminem Show.\\nIn 2004, Moby praised Eminem for criticizing then-U.S. president George W. Bush in the song \"Mosh\", a track from Encore. The feud has since ended. In 2022, Eminem said that he later regretted attacking Moby.\\n\\nMachine Gun Kelly\\nEminem and rapper Machine Gun Kelly have had an ongoing feud for several years, and Kelly released a diss track in response to \"Not Alike\" titled \"Rap Devil\" in September 2018; both songs were produced by Ronny J. Kelly continued the feud at a concert, calling it \"a battle between the past and the fucking future\". The song\\'s title refers to Eminem\\'s \"Rap God\" and Eminem went into the studio days later to record his own response, as did former D12 associate Bizarre. Eminem responded with \"Killshot\" on September 14 and Bizarre\\'s \"Love Tap\" was released on September 20. \"Killshot\" garnered 38.1 million streams on YouTube in its first 24 hours and over 80 million views in its first week, making it the most successful debut for a hip hop song and the third-biggest debut in the platform\\'s history. The track also debuted at number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it Eminem\\'s 20th top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. Kelly has continued the feud publicly.\\n\\nFrom Kamikaze\\nThroughout the 2018 album Kamikaze Eminem\\'s lyrics criticize other musicians, primarily mumble rappers, and several have responded publicly.\\nJa Rule responded on social media, re-igniting a feud the two had 15 years prior. 6ix9ine, Iggy Azalea, Joe Budden, Die Antwoord, Lupe Fiasco, and Lord Jamar have also responded publicly, with 6ix9ine releasing the skit \"Legend\" that raps over Eminem\\'s \"Lose Yourself\".\\n\\nControversies\\nLegal issues\\nEminem had his first run-in with the law at age 20, when he was arrested for his involvement in a drive-by shooting with a paintball gun. The case was dismissed when the victim did not appear in court.\\nOn June 3, 2000, Eminem was arrested during an altercation with Douglas Dail at a car-audio store in Royal Oak, Michigan, when Eminem pulled out an unloaded gun and pointed it at the ground. The next day, in Warren, Michigan, he was arrested again for assaulting John Guerra in the parking lot of the Hot Rock Café when he saw Guerra kissing Eminem\\'s wife. Eminem recreated the Guerra assault in \"The Kiss (Skit)\" on The Eminem Show. He pleaded guilty to possession of a concealed weapon and assault, receiving two years\\' probation; however, Guerra\\'s assault charge was dropped as part of the plea agreement. On June 28, 2001, Eminem was sentenced to one year\\'s probation and community service and was fined about $2,000 on weapon charges stemming from an argument with an employee of Psychopathic Records.\\nIn 1999, Eminem\\'s mother sued him for $10 million, claiming he was slandering her on The Slim Shady LP. Litigation concluded in 2001, resulting in an award of $1,600 for her damages.\\nOn July 7, 2000, Kim Mathers attempted suicide by slitting her wrists, later suing Eminem for defamation after describing her violent death in \"Kim\".\\nSanitation worker DeAngelo Bailey sued Eminem for $1 million in 2001, accusing him of invading his privacy by publicizing information placing Bailey in a false light in \"Brain Damage\", a song that portrays him as a violent school bully. Although Bailey admitted picking on Eminem in school, he said he merely \"bumped\" Eminem and gave him a \"little shove\". The lawsuit was dismissed on October 20, 2003; Judge Deborah Servitto, who wrote a portion of her opinion in rap-like rhyming verse, ruled that it was clear to the public that the lyrics were exaggerated.\\nOn March 31, 2002, French jazz pianist Jacques Loussier filed a $10 million lawsuit against Eminem and Dr. Dre, claiming that the beat for \"Kill You\" was taken from his instrumental \"Pulsion\". Loussier demanded that sales of The Marshall Mathers LP be halted and any remaining copies destroyed. The case was later settled out of court.\\nIn 2006, Eminem was accused of assaulting Miad Jarbou, a resident of Royal Oak, Michigan, in the bathroom of a Detroit strip club, but was never charged. Two years later, Jarbou sued Eminem for more than $25,000 in damages.\\nIn 2007, Eminem\\'s music-publishing company (Eight Mile Style) and Martin Affiliated sued Apple Inc. and Aftermath Entertainment, claiming that Aftermath was not authorized to negotiate a deal with Apple for digital downloads of 93 Eminem songs on Apple\\'s iTunes. The case against Apple was settled shortly after the trial began, in late September 2009.\\nIn July 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in F.B.T. Productions, LLC v. Aftermath Records that F.B.T. Productions and Eminem were owed a royalty of 50 percent of Aftermath\\'s net revenue from licensing his recordings to companies such as Apple, Sprint Corporation, Nextel Communications, Cingular and T-Mobile. In March 2011, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the case.\\nIn October 2013, Eminem sampled Chicago-based rap group Hotstylz\\'s 2008 viral hit, \"Lookin\\' Boy\", for his 2013 hit single \"Rap God\". The group claims that Eminem did not receive permission to use the sample, nor did he credit or compensate them. In November 2013, Hotstylz released a diss track towards Eminem titled \"Rap Fraud\", where they sample several of his songs and criticize him for not crediting them. In January 2015, TMZ reported that Hotstylz was suing Eminem and his label, Shady Records, for $8 million, for using the 25-second sample of \"Lookin\\' Boy\" on his song \"Rap God\" without their permission.\\n\\nUnited States Secret Service\\nOn December 8, 2003, the United States Secret Service reported that it was \"looking into\" allegations that Eminem threatened U.S. president George W. Bush in \"We As Americans\" (an unreleased bootleg at the time), with the lyrics: \"Fuck money, I don\\'t rap for dead presidents. I\\'d rather see the president dead, it\\'s never been said but I set precedents.\" The incident was included in the video for \"Mosh\", as a newspaper clipping on a wall with articles about unfortunate incidents in Bush\\'s career. \"We As Americans\" eventually appeared on Encore\\'s deluxe-edition bonus disc with altered lyrics. The original lyrics can be heard at the end of Immortal Technique\\'s \"Bin Laden\".\\nIn 2018–2019, the Secret Service interviewed Eminem again regarding threatening lyrics towards president Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka.\\n\\nAllegations of homophobia\\nSome of Eminem\\'s lyrics have been criticized for being homophobic, and an Australian politician attempted to ban him from the country. Eminem denies the charge, saying that when he was growing up words such as \"faggot\" and \"queer\" were used generally in a derogatory manner and not specifically toward homosexuals. During a 2010 60 Minutes interview, journalist Anderson Cooper explored the issue:\\n\\nIn 2013, Eminem was accused of homophobia due to the lyrics of the song \"Rap God\", explaining to Rolling Stone, \"I don\\'t know how to say this without saying it how I\\'ve said it a million times. But that word, those kind of words, when I came up battle-rappin\\' or whatever, I never really equated those words ... (to actually mean homosexual)\".\\nIn 2018, Eminem was criticized for using the word \"faggot\" against Tyler, the Creator in the song \"Fall\". Eminem later apologized for using the homophobic slur, saying he went \"too far\". Discussing the issue in a multi-part interview with radio host Sway, Eminem explained that while he meant to stand up for himself, \"I think the word that I called him on that song was one of the things where I felt like, \\'This might be too far.\\'\" He added, \"Because in my quest to hurt him [Tyler], I realize that I was hurting a lot of other people by saying it.\"\\nEminem is a friend of openly gay singer Elton John, and publicly supports gay rights. When asked in an interview with The New York Times about the subject of same-sex marriage being legalized in his home state of Michigan, Eminem responded, \"I think if two people love each other, then what the hell? I think that everyone should have the chance to be equally miserable, if they want\", explaining that his \"overall look on things is a lot more mature than it used to be\".\\n\\nLegacy\\nCredited for popularizing hip hop to a Middle American audience, Eminem\\'s unprecedented global commercial success and acclaimed works for a white rapper is widely recognized for breaking racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. Rising from rags to riches, Eminem\\'s anger-fueled music represented widespread angst and the reality of American underclass. He has been greatly influential for artists of various genres.\\nStephen Hill, the then vice president of African American-themed television network BET (Black Entertainment Television), said in 2002:Eminem gets a pass in the same vein that back during segregation black folks had to be better than average, had to be the best, to be accepted ... he is better than the best. In his own way, he is the best lyricist, alliterator and enunciator out there in hip-hop music. In terms of rapping about the pain that other disenfranchised people feel, there is no one better at their game than Eminem.\\nIn 2002, the BBC said that the perception of Eminem as a \"modern-day William Shakespeare\" was comparable to the reception of American singer Bob Dylan: \"Not since Bob Dylan\\'s heyday in the mid-1960s has an artist\\'s output been subjected to such intense academic scrutiny as an exercise in contemporary soul-searching. US critics point to [Eminem\\'s] vivid portraits of disenfranchised lives—using the stark, direct language of the street—as an accurate reflection of social injustice.\" In addition, the BBC highlighted that, \"Where parents once recoiled in horror [to his music], there now seems a greater willingness to acknowledge a music that is striking such a chord among the American young, angry white underclass.\" Dan Ozzi of Vice highlighted that Eminem during the early 2000s was \"the one artist high school kids seemed to unanimously connect with.... he represented everything high school years are about: blind rage, misguided rebellion, adolescent frustration. He was like a human middle finger. An X-rated Dennis the Menace for a dial-up modem generation.\"\\nWriting for Spin in 2002, rock critic Alan Light compared Eminem to the Beatles\\' John Lennon:\\n\\nEminem is even starting to bear a resemblance to one of those rock icons ... Marshall Mathers is becoming something like this generation\\'s John Lennon ... Lennon and Eminem were both subjects of pickets and protests; they both wrote songs about troubled relationships with their mothers; they both wrote about their strange public lives with their wives; they both wrote about how much they loved their kids. Lennon, of course, was able to find ways to use his voice to advocate for peace rather than just blasting away at litigious family members and various pop stars, but still, few other pop musicians since Lennon have found a way to render their private psychodramas into compelling art as effectively as Eminem.\\nRegarding his rehearsal with Eminem for the \"Stan\" duet at the 2001 Grammy Awards, English singer Elton John said, \"[When] Eminem made his entrance, I got goose bumps, the likes of which I have not felt since I first saw Jimi Hendrix, Mick Jagger, James Brown and Aretha Franklin. Eminem was that good. I just thought, \\'Fuck, this man is amazing\\'. There are very few performers who can grab you like that the first time—only the greats.\" John further praised Eminem, saying, \"Eminem is a true poet of his time, someone we\\'ll be talking about for decades to come. He tells stories in such a powerful and distinctive way. As a lyricist, he\\'s one of the best ever. Eminem does for his audience what [Bob] Dylan did for his: He writes how he feels. His anger, vulnerability and humor come out.\"Concerning the controversy surrounding Eminem due to his transgressive music, American entertainer Madonna had said, \"I like the fact that Eminem is brash and angry and politically incorrect ... He\\'s stirring things up, he\\'s provoking a discussion, he\\'s making people\\'s blood boil. He\\'s reflecting what\\'s going on in society right now. That is what art is supposed to do.\" American musician Stevie Wonder also said, \"Rap to me is a modern blues—a statement of how and where people are at ... I think art is a reflection of our society, and people don\\'t like to confront the realities in society ... But until we really confront the truth, we are going to have a Tupac or Eminem or Biggie Smalls to remind us about it—and thank God. They force people to look at realities in society.\"\\nThe previously mentioned Bob Dylan praised Eminem, along with other artists, in a 2022 interview with the Wall Street Journal.\\nEminem has been credited with boosting the careers of hip hop proteges such as 50 Cent, Yelawolf, Stat Quo, Royce da 5\\'9\", Cashis, Obie Trice, Bobby Creekwater, Boogie and hip hop groups such as D12 and Slaughterhouse. A number of artists have cited Eminem as an influence, including The Weeknd, Usher, Rae Sremmurd, Logic, Joyner Lucas, Lil Wayne, 50 Cent, Kendrick Lamar, Ed Sheeran, J. Cole, Chance the Rapper, Regina Spektor, Lana Del Rey, and Juice WRLD.\\n\\nAchievements and honors\\nWith global sales of over 220 million records, Eminem is one of the best-selling music artists ever. He has had thirteen number-one albums on the Billboard 200: nine solo, two with D12 and one with Bad Meets Evil. He was the bestselling music artist from 2000 to 2009 in the US according to Nielsen SoundScan. He was also the bestselling male music artist in the United States of the 2010s. He has sold 47.4 million albums in the country and 107.5 million singles in the US. The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Curtain Call: The Hits, \"Lose Yourself\", \"Love the Way You Lie\" and \"Not Afraid\" have all been certified Diamond or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Eminem has over ten billion views of his music videos on his YouTube Vevo page, and in 2014 Spotify named him the most-streamed music artist ever.\\nAmong Eminem\\'s awards is 15 Grammy Awards, eight American Music Awards and 17 Billboard Music Awards, Billboard named him the \"Artist of the Decade (2000–2009)\". In 2013, he received the Global Icon Award at that year\\'s MTV Europe Music Awards ceremony. His success in 8 Mile saw him win the 2002 Academy Award for Best Original Song for his song \"Lose Yourself\", co-written with Jeff Bass and Luis Resto, making him the first rapper to receive the award. He also won the MTV Movie & TV Awards for Best Actor in a Movie and Best Breakthrough Performance and the Critics\\' Choice Movie Award for Best Song for \"Lose Yourself\".\\nEminem has also been included and ranked in several publications\\' lists. Rolling Stone included him in its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time. He was ranked 9th on MTV\\'s Greatest MCs of All Time list. He was ranked 13th on MTV\\'s 22 Greatest Voices in Music list and 79th on the VH1 100 Greatest Artists of All Time lists. He was ranked 82nd on Rolling Stone\\'s \"The Immortals\" list. In 2010, MTV Portugal ranked Eminem the 7th biggest icon in popular music history. In 2012, The Source ranked him 6th on their list of the Top 50 Lyricists of All Time, while About.com ranked him 7th on its list of the 50 Greatest MCs of Our Time (1987–2007). In 2015, Eminem was placed third on \"The 10 Best Rappers of All Time\" list by Billboard. In 2008, Vibe readers named Eminem the Best Rapper Alive. In 2011, Eminem was labeled the \"King of Hip-Hop\" by Rolling Stone based on an analysis of album sales, chart positions, YouTube views, social media following, concert grosses, industry awards and critical ratings of solo rappers who released music from 2009 to the first half of 2011.\\nEminem was also inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Class of 2022, alongside Duran Duran and Dolly Parton.\\n\\nLiterary works\\nDiscography\\nStudio albums\\n\\nInfinite (1996)\\nThe Slim Shady LP (1999)\\nThe Marshall Mathers LP (2000)\\nThe Eminem Show (2002)\\nEncore (2004)\\nRelapse (2009)\\nRecovery (2010)\\nThe Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013)\\nRevival (2017)\\nKamikaze (2018)\\nMusic to Be Murdered By (2020)\\nThe Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce) (2024)\\nExtended plays\\n\\nSlim Shady EP (1997)\\nCollaborative albums\\n\\nDevil\\'s Night (with D12) (2001)\\nD12 World (with D12) (2004)\\nEminem Presents: The Re-Up (with Shady Records) (2006)\\nHell: The Sequel (with Bad Meets Evil) (2011)\\nShady XV (with Shady Records) (2014)\\nCollaborative EPs\\n\\nThe Underground E.P.

              " 'Curtis James Jackson III (born July 6, 1975), known professionally as 50 Cent, is an American rapper, actor, television producer, and businessman. Born in South Jamaica, a neighborhood of Queens, Jackson began pursuing a musical career in 1996. In 1999-2000, he recorded his \"debut\" album Power of the Dollar for Columbia Records; however, he was struck by nine bullets during a shooting in May 2000, causing its release to be cancelled and Jackson to be dropped from the label. His 2002 mixtape, Guess Who\\'s Back? was discovered by Detroit rapper Eminem, who signed Jackson to his label Shady Records, an imprint of Dr. Dre\\'s Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records that same year.\\nHis debut studio album, Get Rich or Die Tryin\\' (2003) was released to critical acclaim and commercial success. Peaking atop the Billboard 200, it spawned the Billboard Hot 100-number one singles \"In da Club\" and \"21 Questions\" (featuring Nate Dogg), and received nonuple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). That same year, he launched the record label G-Unit Records, namesake of a hip hop group he formed two years prior; the label\\'s initial signees were its members, fellow East Coast rappers Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo. His second album, The Massacre (2005) was met with similar success and supported by his third number-one single, \"Candy Shop\" (featuring Olivia). He adopted a lighter, further commercially-oriented approach for his third and fourth albums, Curtis (2007) and Before I Self Destruct (2009)—both were met with critical and commercial declines—and aimed for a return to his roots with his fifth album, Animal Ambition (2014). He has since focused on his career in television and media, having executive-produced and starred in the television series Power (2014–2020), as well as its numerous spin-offs under his company G-Unit Films and Television Inc.\\nJackson has sold over 30 million albums worldwide and won several awards, including a Grammy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, thirteen Billboard Music Awards, six World Music Awards, three American Music Awards and four BET Awards. In his acting career, Jackson first starred in the semi-autobiographical film Get Rich or Die Tryin\\' (2005), which was critically panned. He was also cast in the war film Home of the Brave (2006), and the crime thriller Righteous Kill (2008). Billboard ranked Jackson as 17th on their \"50 Greatest Rappers\" list in 2023, and named him the sixth top artist of the 2000s decade. Rolling Stone ranked Get Rich or Die Tryin\\' and \"In da Club\" in its lists of the \"100 Best Albums of the 2000s\" and \"100 Best Songs of the 2000s\" at numbers 37 and 13, respectively.\\n\\nEarly life\\nJackson was born in the borough of Queens, New York City, and raised in its South Jamaica neighborhood by his mother Sabrina. Sabrina, a drug dealer, raised Jackson until she died in a fire when Jackson was eight years old. Jackson revealed in an interview that his mother was a lesbian. After his mother\\'s death and his father\\'s departure, Jackson was raised by his grandparents.\\nHe began boxing at about age 11, and when he was 14, a neighbor opened a boxing gym for local youth. \"When I wasn\\'t killing time in school, I was sparring in the gym or selling  crack on the strip,\" Jackson remembered. He sold crack during primary school. \"I was competitive in the ring and hip-hop is competitive too ... I think rappers condition themselves like boxers, so they all kind of feel like they\\'re the champ.\"\\nAt age 12, Jackson began dealing narcotics when his grandparents thought he was in after-school programs, and brought guns and drug money to school. In the tenth grade, he was caught by metal detectors at Andrew Jackson High School: \"I was embarrassed that I got arrested like that ... After I got arrested I stopped hiding it. I was telling my grandmother [openly], \\'I sell drugs.\\'\"\\nOn June 29, 1994, Jackson was arrested for selling four vials of cocaine to an undercover police officer. He was arrested again three weeks later, when police searched his home and found heroin, ten ounces of crack cocaine, and a starting pistol. Although Jackson was sentenced to three to nine years in prison, he served six months in a boot camp and earned his GED. He has said that he did not use cocaine himself. Jackson adopted the nickname \"50 Cent\" as a metaphor for change. The name was inspired by Kelvin Martin, a 1980s Brooklyn robber known as \"50 Cent\"; Jackson chose it \"because it says everything I want it to say. I\\'m the same kind of person 50 Cent was. I provide for myself by any means.\"\\n\\nCareer\\n1996–2002: Rise to fame, shooting, and early mixtapes\\nJackson began rapping in a friend\\'s basement, where he used turntables to record over instrumentals. In 1996, a friend introduced him to Jam Master Jay of Run-DMC, who was establishing Jam Master Jay Records. Jay taught him how to count bars, write choruses, structure songs, and make records. Jackson\\'s first appearance was on \"React\" with Onyx, for their 1998 album Shut \\'Em Down. He credited Jam Master Jay for improving his ability to write hooks, and Jay produced Jackson\\'s first (unreleased) album. In 1999, after Jackson left Jam Master Jay, the platinum-selling producers Trackmasters signed him to Columbia Records. They sent him to an upstate New York studio, where he produced 36 songs in two weeks; 18 were included on his 2000 album, Power of the Dollar. Jackson founded Hollow Point Entertainment with former G-Unit member Bang \\'Em Smurf.\\nJackson\\'s popularity began to grow after the successful, controversial underground single \"How to Rob\", which he wrote in a half-hour car ride to a studio. The track comically describes how he would rob famous artists. Jackson explained the song\\'s rationale: \"There\\'s a hundred artists on that label, you gotta separate yourself from that group and make yourself relevant.\" Rappers Jay-Z, Kurupt, Sticky Fingaz, Big Pun, DMX, Wyclef Jean, and the Wu-Tang Clan responded to the track, and Nas invited Jackson to join him on his Nastradamus tour. Although \"How to Rob\" was intended to be released with \"Thug Love\" (with Destiny\\'s Child), two days before he was scheduled to film the \"Thug Love\" music video, Jackson was shot and hospitalized.\\nOn May 24, 2000, Jackson was attacked by a gunman outside his grandmother\\'s former home in South Jamaica. After getting into a friend\\'s car, he was asked to return to the house to get some jewelry; his son was in the house, and his grandmother was in the front yard. Jackson returned to the back seat of the car, and another car pulled up nearby; an assailant walked up and fired nine shots at close range with a 9mm handgun. Jackson was shot in the hand, arm, hip, both legs, chest, and left cheek. His facial wound resulted in a swollen tongue, the loss of a wisdom tooth and a slightly slurred voice; his friend was wounded in the hand. They were driven to a hospital, where Jackson spent 13 days. The alleged attacker, Darryl \"Homicide\" Baum, Mike Tyson\\'s close friend and bodyguard, was killed three weeks later.\\nJackson recalled the shooting: \"It happens so fast that you don\\'t even get a chance to shoot back .... I was scared the whole time ... I was looking in the rear-view mirror like, \\'Oh shit, somebody shot me in the face! It burns, burns, burns.\\'\" In his autobiography, From Pieces to Weight: Once upon a Time in Southside Queens, he wrote: \"After I got shot nine times at close range and didn\\'t die, I started to think that I must have a purpose in life ... How much more damage could that shell have done? Give me an inch in this direction or that one, and I\\'m gone.\" Jackson used a walker for six weeks and fully recovered after five months. When he left the hospital, he stayed in the Poconos with his girlfriend and son, and his workout regime helped him develop a muscular physique.\\nIn the hospital, Jackson signed a publishing deal with Columbia Records before he was dropped from the label and blacklisted by the recording industry because of his song, \"Ghetto Qu\\'ran\". Unable to work in a U.S. studio, he went to Canada. With business partner Sha Money XL, Jackson recorded over thirty songs for mixtapes to build a reputation. In a HitQuarters interview, Marc Labelle of Shady Records A&R said that Jackson used the mixtape circuit to his advantage: \"He took all the hottest beats from every artist and flipped them with better hooks. They then got into all the markets on the mixtapes and all the mixtape DJs were messing with them.\" Jackson\\'s popularity increased, and in 2002 he released the mixtape Guess Who\\'s Back?. He then released 50 Cent Is the Future backed by G-Unit, a mixtape revisiting material by Jay-Z and Raphael Saadiq.\\n\\n2002–2007: Mainstream breakthrough, Get Rich or Die Tryin\\', and The Massacre\\nIn 2002, Eminem heard Jackson\\'s Guess Who\\'s Back? album, received from Jackson\\'s attorney (who was working with Eminem\\'s manager, Paul Rosenberg). Impressed, Eminem invited Jackson to fly to Los Angeles and introduced him to Dr. Dre. After signing a $1 million record deal, Jackson released No Mercy, No Fear. The mixtape featured one new track, \"Wanksta\", which appeared on Eminem\\'s 8 Mile soundtrack. Jackson was also signed by Violator Management and Sha Money XL\\'s Money Management Group.\\n50 Cent released his debut album, Get Rich or Die Tryin\\' (described by AllMusic as \"probably the most hyped debut album by a rap artist in about a decade\"), in February 2003. Rolling Stone noted its \"dark synth grooves, buzzy keyboards and a persistently funky bounce\", with Jackson complementing the production in \"an unflappable, laid-back flow\". It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 872,000 copies in its first four days. The lead single, \"In da Club\" (noted by The Source for its \"blaring horns, funky organs, guitar riffs and sparse hand claps\"), set a Billboard record as the most listened-to song in radio history within a week.\\nInterscope began funding and distributing for Jackson\\'s label, G-Unit Records, in 2003. He signed Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo and Young Buck as members of G-Unit, and The Game was later signed in a joint venture with Dr. Dre\\'s Aftermath Entertainment. G-Unit Records replaced Jackson\\'s previous imprint, Rotten Apple Entertainment. 50 Cent executive produced Lloyd Banks\\'s June 2004 debut studio album, The Hunger for More, which achieved Platinum status in America. 50 Cent also contributed vocals to Lloyd Banks\\'s hit single, \"On Fire\". In March 2005, 50 Cent\\'s second commercial album, The Massacre, sold 1.14 million copies in its first four days (the highest in an abbreviated sales cycle) and was number one on the Billboard 200 for six weeks. He was the first solo artist with three singles in the Billboard top five in the same week with \"Candy Shop\", \"Disco Inferno\" and \"How We Do\". According to Rolling Stone, \"50\\'s secret weapon is his singing voice - the deceptively amateur-sounding tenor croon that he deploys on almost every chorus\". 50 Cent\\'s video game, 50 Cent: Bulletproof was released in November 2005. 50 Cent portrays himself and provides his likeness and voice in the video game, with the video game also featuring music from his first two studio albums.\\n\\nAfter The Game\\'s departure Jackson signed Olivia and rap veterans Mobb Deep to G-Unit Records, with Spider Loc, M.O.P., 40 Glocc and Young Hot Rod later joining the label, who all eventually departed the label. Jackson expressed an interest in working with rappers other than G-Unit, such as Lil\\' Scrappy of BME, LL Cool J of Def Jam, Mase of Bad Boy and Freeway of Roc-A-Fella, and recorded with several.\\n\\n2007–2010: Curtis, sales battle with Kanye West, and Before I Self Destruct\\nIn September 2007, 50 Cent released his third album, Curtis, which was inspired by his life before Get Rich or Die Tryin\\'. It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, selling 691,000 copies during its first week. It sold behind Kanye West\\'s Graduation, released the same day; the outcome of this highly-publicized sales battle between Jackson and West has been accredited to the commercial decline of the gangsta rap and \"bling era\" style that previously dominated mainstream hip-hop.\\nOn the September 10, 2008, episode of Total Request Live, Jackson said his fourth studio album, Before I Self Destruct, would be \"done and released in November\". He released \"Ok, You\\'re Right\", produced by Dr. Dre for Before I Self Destruct, on May 18, 2009, and was scheduled to appear in a fall 2009 episode of VH1\\'s Behind the Music. On September 3, 2009, Jackson posted a video  for the Soundkillers\\' Phoenix- produced track, \"Flight 187\", introducing his mixtape and book (The 50th Law). The song, with lyrics inspiring speculation about tension between Jackson and Jay-Z, was a bonus track on the iTunes version of Before I Self Destruct. Before I Self Destruct was released on November 9, 2009 and debuted at number 5 on the Billboard 200, giving 50 Cent his fourth consecutive top 5 album in the US.\\n\\n2010–2015: New musical directions, new business ventures, and Animal Ambition\\nIn a Contactmusic.com interview, Jackson said he was working on a Eurodance album, Black Magic, inspired by European nightclubs: \"First they played hip-hop which suddenly changed to uptempo songs, known as Eurodance\". He later said he had changed his next album to The Return of the Heartless Monster after writing different material when he returned home from the Invitation Tour in 2010, shelving Black Magic. On September 3, Jackson supported Eminem on his and Jay-Z\\'s The Home & Home Tour, performing \"Crack A Bottle\" with Eminem and Dr. Dre amid rumors of tension between Jackson and Dre.\\nHe \"recorded 20 songs to a whole different album concept\" before putting them aside, wanting his new album to have the \"aggression\" of Get Rich or Die Tryin\\'. Jackson tweeted that the album was \"80 percent done\" and fans could expect it in the summer of 2011. It was ultimately delayed a year due to disagreements with Interscope Records, with Jackson saying that he would release it in November 2011 with a different title than Black Magic. Eminem would appear on the album, and Jackson said he was working with new producers such as Boi-1da and Alex da Kid. Cardiak, who produced Lloyd Banks\\' \"Start It Up\", confirmed that he produced a song for the upcoming album.\\n\\nJackson released a song, \"Outlaw\", from his fifth album on the Internet on June 16, 2011. The single, produced by Cardiak, was released on iTunes on July 19 (although Jackson tweeted that it was not the album\\'s first single). The rapper planned to write a semi-autobiographical young-adult novel about bullying, different from his previous books which focused on his life and the rules of power. According to the book\\'s publisher, the first-person novel (about a 13-year-old schoolyard bully \"who finds redemption as he faces what he\\'s done\") was scheduled for publication in January 2012.\\nIn a series of tweets, Jackson said that the delay of his fifth album was due to disagreements with Interscope Records, later suggesting that it would be released in November 2011 with his headphone line (SMS by 50). He speculated to MTV News about not renewing his five-album contract with Interscope: \"I don\\'t know ... It will all be clear in the negotiations following me turning this actual album in. And, of course, the performance and how they actually treat the work will determine whether you still want to stay in that position or not.\"\\nOn June 20, 2011, Jackson announced the release of Before I Self Destruct II after his fifth album. Although he planned to shoot a music video for the fifth album\\'s lead single, \"I\\'m On It\", on June 26 the video was never filmed. Jackson told Shade45, \"I did four songs in Detroit with Eminem. I did two with Just Blaze, a Boi-1da joint, and I did something with Alex da Kid. We made two that are definite singles and the other two are the kinds of records that we been making, more aimed at my core audience, more aggressive, more of a different kind of energy to it.\" He released \"Street King Energy Track #7\" in September 2011 to promote Street King, his charity-based energy drink. An announcement that Jackson was shooting a music video for \"Girls Go Wild\", the fifth-album lead single featuring Jeremih, was made on September 28, 2011.\\nJackson\\'s fifth album, Street King Immortal, was initially scheduled for a summer 2012 release and postponed until November 13. Disagreements with Interscope Records about its release and promotion led to its temporary cancellation. Its first promo single, \"New Day\" with Dr. Dre and Alicia Keys, was released on July 27. The song was produced by Dr. Dre, mixed by Eminem and written by 50 Cent, Alicia Keys, Royce da 5\\'9\" and Dr. Dre. A solo version by Keys was leaked by her husband, Swizz Beatz. \"My Life\", the album\\'s second promo single (with Eminem and Maroon 5 lead singer Adam Levine), was released on November 26, 2012.\\nIn January 2014, Jackson said he planned to release Animal Ambition in the first quarter of the year, followed by Street King Immortal. On February 20, he left Shady Records, Aftermath Entertainment, and Interscope, signing with Caroline and Capitol Music Group. According to Jackson, although he owed Interscope another album, he was released from his contract because of his friendship with Eminem and Dr. Dre: \"I\\'m a special case and situation. It\\'s also because of the leverage of having the strong relationships with Eminem and Dr. Dre. They don\\'t want me to be uncomfortable. They value our friendship to the point that they would never want [to jeopardize] it over that little bit of money.\"\\nThat day, he announced that Animal Ambition would be released on June 3 and released its first track. The song, \"Funeral\", was released with a video on Forbes.com. Produced by Jake One, it is a continuation of \"50 Bars\" from a previous album; two more tracks were scheduled for release on March 18. At South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, Jackson performed \"Hold On\" from the new album. That song and \"Don\\'t Worry \\'Bout It\" were released with accompanying videos on March 18. According to Jackson, prosperity would be a theme of the album: \"This project, I had to search for a concept, a really good concept, in my perspective, and that was prosperity. I outlined all the things that would be a part of prosperity, positive and negative [for Animal Ambition].\"\\nAnimal Ambition debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200, giving 50 Cent his fifth consecutive top five album in the country, while also debuting at number one on Billboard\\'s Independent Albums chart.\\n\\n2015–2021: Street King Immortal, bankruptcy, and departure from Interscope\\nOn May 14, 2015, Jackson revealed in an interview that the first single from Street King Immortal, would be previewed Memorial Day weekend and would likely be released in June. Jackson released \"Get Low\" on May 20, 2015, as the intended first single from his sixth studio album, Street King Immortal. The song, produced by Remo the Hitmaker, features vocals from fellow American rappers 2 Chainz and T.I., as well as American singer Jeremih. He announced bankruptcy on July 13, 2015.\\nOn March 31, 2017, Interscope Records released 50 Cent\\'s final album for the label, a greatest hits album titled Best Of.\\nIn 2020, Jackson led the executive-producer duties for late rapper Pop Smoke\\'s debut album, Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon, having been one of Pop Smoke\\'s biggest inspirations. The album was released on July 3, 2020. Jackson curated the album, desiring to finish it after Pop had died. He contacted many of the artists involved, and also features on one of the album tracks, \"The Woo\". The Woo also features vocals from fellow American rapper Roddy Ricch.\\nIn 2020, it was reported that Jackson was producing two television series for Starz, an anthology about hip hop and a biographical drama about sports agent Nicole Lynn.\\nIn 2021, he became one of the headliners of the music festival Golden Sand in Riviera Maya.\\nIn a July 2021 interview with The Independent, 50 Cent confirmed that he had officially decided to shelve his Street King Immortal album after it spent a decade in development hell. He even confirmed that he plans to release a completely new project.\\n\\n2021–present: Focusing on acting and media production, Super Bowl LVI halftime show performance\\nIn May 2021, Curtis Jackson moved to Houston. This was thought to be for lower taxes, no income tax, and for the rapper scene, as well as other ventures such as writing new screenplays.

The application was published in 2003, and registration issued in 2004. He has since filed for additional trademark registrations.\\nIn July 2011, Jackson launched a philanthropic initiative to provide food for one billion starving people in Africa by 2016, joining Pure Growth Partners to introduce Street King. A portion of the proceeds from each Street King purchase would be used to provide a daily meal to an underprivileged child. The partnership coincides with Jackson\\'s goal to feed a billion people in Africa during the next five years. \"50 Cent and I share a common vision: to address the world\\'s problems through smart and sustainable business models,\" said Chris Clarke, founder and CEO of Pure Growth Partners. \"With the rampant starvation in Africa and hunger afflicting children worldwide, we need socially responsible businesses that affect real change now more than ever.\" Jackson said, \"I\\'m inspired by Clarke\\'s vision and innovative approaches to tackling serious issues. It\\'s our mission with Street King to really change children\\'s lives around the world.\" In 2011, he founded SMS Audio, a consumer-electronics company selling Street by 50 headphones, pledging to donate a portion of their sales to charity.

In April 2015, Jackson mulled investing in Jamaica, exploring foreign investment opportunities on the island when he met with some local officials and had ongoing discussions on investment opportunities in the Montego Bay resort area.\\n\\nInvestments\\nOver the years, Jackson invested his earnings from music and celebrity endorsements in an array of privately controlled companies, real estate, and stocks and bonds. A portion of his investments lost value during the 2008 recession. In December 2008, he told the Canadian press that he had been affected by the recession, losing several million dollars in the stock market. Unable to sell his Connecticut mansion, Jackson postponed Before I Self-Destruct due to the severity of the economic downturn.\\nHis Farmington mansion located on 50 Poplar Hill Drive that he tried to sell for years filed for bankruptcy in Connecticut in 2015 listed an asking price for that property in 2012 at $10 million but was valued at $8.3 million in 2015. He first tried to sell the house in 2007 for $18.5 million, and dropped the price several times in the next five years, when it was on and off the market.\\nIn January 2011, Jackson reportedly made $10 million after using Twitter to promote a marketing company which he was part shareholder of. His endorsements company G Unit Brands Inc. revealed through a public SEC filing controls 12.9 per cent of H&H Imports, which is a parent company of TV Goods – the firm responsible for marketing his range of headphones, Sleek by 50 Cent. Jackson bought stock in the company on November 30, 2010, a week after it offered buyers 180 million shares at 17 cents each. Jackson later made a stock recommendation on Twitter, causing its share value to rise from four cents to nearly 50 cents (32p) each, closing on Monday at 39 cents (25p).

After his meeting with Motsepe, Jackson considered purchasing equity in the mine and launching his own line of 50 Cent branded platinum.\\n\\nBoxing promotion\\nOn July 21, 2012, Jackson became a licensed boxing promoter when he formed his new company, TMT (The Money Team). Licensed to promote in New York, he was in the process of being licensed in Nevada (where most major fights are held in the U.S.). A former amateur boxer, Jackson signed gold medalist and former featherweight champion Yuriorkis Gamboa and middleweight Olympic medalist Andre Dirrell. On July 29, 2012, he and the boxer Floyd Mayweather, Jr., signed IBF featherweight champion Billy Dib. They unveiled plans to challenge the box-office dominance of mixed martial arts and change the landscape of boxing with TMT Promotions. Boxer Zab Judah also expressed interest in making a deal with Jackson. In December 2012, Mayweather and Jackson parted company, with Jackson taking over the promotion company and founding SMS Promotions with Gamboa, Dirrell, Dib, James Kirkland, Luis Olivares and Donte Strayhorn in his stable.\\n\\nBankruptcy\\nOn July 13, 2015, Jackson filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut with a debt of $32,509,549.91. On July 17, 2015, the Court issued an order allowing a creditor to proceed with the punitive damages phase of a trial against Jackson in a New York state court, in connection with the alleged release of a private video. His assets were listed as between $10 million and $50 million in his bankruptcy petition, though he testified under oath that he is worth $4.4 million. Citing between $10 million and $50 million in debt, and the same amount in assets. Later in the week, Jackson\\'s bankruptcy lawyers elucidated the court documents that legal fees and judgments exceeding $20 million over the past year were the primary cause of the filing.\\nHis filings listed 32 entities that he has a stake in. The bankruptcy came days after a jury ordered him to pay $5 million to rapper Rick Ross\\'s ex-girlfriend Lastonia Leviston for invading her privacy by posting online a sex tape of her and another man. In addition, Jackson lost a dispute over a failed business deal to come to fruition to his Sleek headphones, where Jackson invested more than $2 million. An ex-partner accused Jackson of later stealing the design of the \"Sleek by 50\" headphones, prompting a judge to award the partner more than $17.2 million. His Connecticut bankruptcy filing states that he owns seven cars valued at more than $500,000, including a 2010 Rolls-Royce and a 1966 Chevrolet Coupe. His expenses of $108,000 a month include $5,000 for gardening along with a monthly income of $185,000, mainly from royalties and income from his external businesses and investments. The court filing says he also owes money to his stylist, his barber, and his fitness coach.\\nOther details in the bankruptcy documents included information about two deals that sold the right to collect royalties of on-air play of his music. Half the rights to his portfolio were sold to the British independent music publishing company Kobalt Music Group for $3 million and the other half for another $3 million with the sales of his albums allowing Jackson to own 100 percent of the rights to the master recordings while paying only for distribution. Zeisler & Zeisler, a Bridgeport law firm, represented 50 Cent in the bankruptcy, which later resulted in Jackson filing a $75 million lawsuit against his own lawyers. He stated that his lawyers did a terrible job of representing him, specifically citing the fallout of his failed venture with Sleek Audio headphones and accused Garvey Schubert Barer, a Wall Street law firm, of failing to \"employ the requisite knowledge and skill necessary to confront the circumstances of the case\".\\n\\nCorporate positions\\nG-Unity Foundation Inc. – Founder\\nSMS Audio – CEO, founder\\nSK Energy – Founder\\nSMS Promotions – CEO, founder\\nSire Spirits – Owner\\nEffen Vodka – Former minority shareholder\\n\\nPersonal life\\n50 Cent has said his life philosophy, following his shooting, is \"When your time comes, you go. I think that comes from God.\" Despite having numerous songs that reference drug and alcohol usage and his ownership of Branson Cognac, Jackson remains teetotal, citing a bad experience with alcohol as his main reason.\\nForbes noted Jackson\\'s wealth in 2007, ranking him second behind Jay-Z in the rap industry. He lived in a Farmington, Connecticut, mansion formerly owned by ex-boxer Mike Tyson. Jackson listed the mansion for sale in 2007 at $18.5 million to move closer to his son (who lived on Long Island at the time). In 2019, the mansion was sold for $2.9 million, with $1 million being donated to tax-deducted charities.\\nThe mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut, declared October 12, 2007 \"50 Cent Curtis Jackson Day\", honoring the rapper with a proclamation and a key to the city. One of Jackson\\'s New York homes, purchased in January 2007 for $2.4 million and the center of a lawsuit between Jackson and Shaniqua Tompkins, caught fire on May 31, 2008, while he was filming in Louisiana.\\nIn December 2008, he told the Canadian press that he had lost several million dollars in the stock market and, unable to sell his Connecticut mansion, had postponed Before I Self-Destruct because of the economic downturn. Jackson won a lawsuit in November 2009 against Taco Bell over the fast-food chain\\'s use of his name without permission.\\n\\nFamily and relationships\\nOn October 13, 1996, Jackson\\'s girlfriend, Shaniqua Tompkins, gave birth to son Marquise. Tompkins later sued Jackson for $50 million in 2009, saying he promised to take care of her for life. The suit, with 15 causes of action, was dismissed by a judge who called it \"an unfortunate tale of a love relationship gone sour\". The two have bickered for years, and have even taken their feud to social media many times.\\nMarquise\\'s birth changed Jackson\\'s outlook on life: \"When my son came into my life, my priorities changed, because I wanted to have the relationship with him that I didn\\'t have with my father.\" He credited his son for inspiring his career and being the \"motivation to go in a different direction\". Despite this, the two have endured a fractured relationship that began when Jackson and Tompkins separated in 2008. Their feud has been taken to social media numerous times, including in 2020 when Jackson disclosed that he \"used to\" love his son. Jackson has a tattoo \"Marquise\" with an axe on his right biceps (\"The axe is \\'cause I\\'m a warrior. I don\\'t want him to be one, though\"), and has \"50\", \"Southside\" and \"Cold World\" on his back: \"I\\'m a product of that environment. It\\'s on my back, though, so it\\'s all behind me\".\\nIn 2003, Jackson briefly dated actress Vivica A. Fox. He broke up with her only eight months later on the radio.\\nJackson dated model Daphne Joy and had his second son, Sire Jackson, with her, on September 1, 2012. At the age of two years, Sire modeled for Kidz Safe, a headphone brand for kids, earning $700,000 through his contract.\\n\\nPolitical views\\nIn 2005, Jackson supported President George W. Bush after rapper Kanye West criticized Bush for a slow response to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. If his felony convictions did not prevent him from voting, he said that he would have voted for the president. Jackson later said that Bush \"has less compassion than the average human. By all means, I don\\'t aspire to be like George Bush.\" In September 2007, he told Time that although he would not endorse a candidate in 2008, he \"liked Hillary [Clinton]\".\\nSix months later, the rapper told MTV News that he had switched his support to Barack Obama after hearing him speak, but had lost interest in politics. Asked his opinion of President Obama\\'s May 9, 2012, endorsement of gay marriage, Jackson said, \"I\\'m for it ... I\\'ve encouraged same-sex activities. I\\'ve engaged in fetish areas a couple times.\" He had been criticized for anti-gay comments in the past.\\nJackson endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He rejected an offer of $500,000 from the Trump campaign to make an appearance on the candidate\\'s behalf. However, he endorsed Donald Trump in 2020, due to his dislike of Joe Biden\\'s tax plans. A week later, he retracted his endorsement, saying on Twitter \"Fuck Donald Trump, I never liked him\", and endorsed Biden.\\n\\nLegal issues\\nOn June 29, 1994, Jackson was arrested for selling four vials of cocaine to an undercover police officer. He was arrested again three weeks later, when police searched his home and found heroin, ten ounces of crack cocaine and a starter\\'s pistol. Although Jackson was sentenced to three to nine years in prison, he served six months in a boot camp (where he earned his high-school equivalency diploma). According to him, he did not use cocaine.\\nJackson and four members of his entourage were arrested shortly before 2 a.m. on December 31, 2002, when police found a .25-caliber handgun and a .45-caliber pistol in a parked car (which they searched due to its tinted windows) outside a Manhattan nightclub. The rapper was charged with two counts of criminal possession of a weapon.\\nJackson was sentenced to two years\\' probation on July 22, 2005, for a May 2004 incident, when he was charged with three counts of assault and battery after jumping into an audience when he was hit by a water bottle.\\n\\nLawsuits\\nUse of image\\nJackson filed a lawsuit against an advertising company, Traffix of Pearl River, New York, on July 21, 2007, for using his image in a promotion he said threatened his safety. He was alerted by a staff member to an Internet advertisement on a Myspace page. According to court documents, the advertisement had a cartoon image of the rapper with \"Shoot the rapper and you will win $5000 or five ring tones guaranteed\". Although the ad did not use his name, the image allegedly resembled him and suggested that he endorsed the product. The lawsuit, calling the ad a \"vile, tasteless and despicable\" use of Jackson\\'s image which \"quite literally call[ed] for violence against him\", sought unspecified punitive damages and a permanent injunction against the use of his image without permission.\\n\\nUse of name\\nIn 2008, Jackson sued Taco Bell over an ad campaign in which it invited him to change his name for one day from 50 Cent to 79 Cent, 89 Cent, or 99 Cent, in line with pricing for some of its items, and they would donate $10,000 to the charity of his choice. The case was settled out of court.\\n\\nJanitor incident\\nWhile walking through Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in May 2016, Jackson harassed and insulted a janitor at the airport, accusing him of being under the influence. The janitor was a hearing-impaired, autistic teenager named Andrew Farrell. The parents of the janitor had seen the viral video as disrespect and wanted to sue Jackson for his action against their child. The lawsuit was originally over one million dollars, but the parents settled for a $100,000 donation to Autism Speaks and his apology.\\n\\nBamba sample\\nIn 2016, a judge declared that Brandon Parrott gave Dr. Dre and 50 Cent the rights to \"Bamba\" for the song \"P.I.M.P.\"\\n\\nOther civil and criminal matters\\nOne of his New York homes, purchased for $2.4 million in January 2007 and the center of a lawsuit between Jackson and Shaniqua Tompkins, caught fire on May 30, 2008, while he was filming in Louisiana. On August 5, 2013, Jackson pleaded not guilty to one count of domestic violence and four counts of vandalism in a Los Angeles County court. If convicted of all charges, he faced up to five years in prison and a $46,000 fine. Model-actress Daphne Joy accused Jackson of kicking her and ransacking her bedroom during an argument at her condominium in the Toluca Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles on June 23. He allegedly caused $7,100 in property damage, leaving the scene before police arrived.\\nJudge Ann Nevins has ordered Jackson back to court because of Instagram messages he made over several months. She said Jackson was not fully clear about his funds and indicated posts of the rapper showing stacks of his money. In March 2016, Jackson claimed that he would no longer use Instagram, electing instead to have his profile page operated by someone else.\\nIn 2020, Jackson was a subject of controversy for his involvement in a viral video of him giving money to a Burger King restaurant in New York City on behalf of a local scammer who was later arrested and charged for Bitcoin scamming and for assaulting and kidnapping his victims on April 24, 2021.\\n\\nFeuds\\nJa Rule\\nBefore he signed with Interscope Records, Jackson engaged in a public dispute with rapper Ja Rule and his label, Murder Inc. Records, saying that a friend robbed jewelry from Ja Rule and the latter accused him of orchestrating the robbery. Ja Rule said that the conflict stemmed from a Queens video shoot, when Jackson did not like seeing him \"getting so much love\" from the neighborhood. At The Hit Factory in New York in March 2000, Jackson had an altercation with Murder Inc. associates and received three stitches for a stab wound. Rapper Black Child claimed responsibility for the stabbing, saying that he acted in self-defense when he thought someone reached for a gun.\\nAn affidavit by an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agent suggested ties between Murder Inc. and Kenneth \"Supreme\" McGriff, a New York drug lord suspected of involvement in the murder of Jam Master Jay and Jackson\\'s shooting. An excerpt read:\\n\\nThe investigation has uncovered a conspiracy involving McGriff and others to murder a rap artist who has released songs containing lyrics regarding McGriff\\'s criminal activities. The rap artist was shot in 2000, survived and thereafter refused to cooperate with law enforcement regarding the shooting. Messages transmitted over the Murder Inc. pager indicate that McGriff is involved in an ongoing plot to kill this rap artist, and that he communicates with Murder Inc. employees concerning the target.\\nThe end of the Jackson-Ja Rule feud was confirmed in May 2011. According to Ja Rule, \"I\\'m cool. We ain\\'t beefing no more. We\\'ll never collaborate. That\\'s just what it is. You don\\'t have to be at war with somebody, but it\\'s also kind of like U.S. and another country that they may not get along with. We don\\'t gotta go to war, but we\\'re not friends either. But we can coincide inside of a world. He\\'s doing him, and he\\'s not thinking about me, and I\\'m doing me and I\\'m not thinking about him.\"\\nOn August 7, 2015, the feud between the two rappers later reignited when Ja Rule gave a feedback to a social follower via Twitter over a similar feud between Meek Mill and Drake. Enraged, Jackson later responded with photos and comments via Instagram, only siding with Drake. The feud resurfaced three years later on January 19, 2018, when Ja Rule took to Twitter, calling out 50 Cent on social media.\\n\\nJay-Z and Beyoncé\\nIn 1999, with the release of the single \"How to Rob\", 50 Cent attacked his rap peers, including Jay-Z, who responded to the provocation with the single \"It\\'s Hot (Some Like It Hot)\" in which he raps \"Go against Jigga yo ass is dense/I\\'m about a dollar – what the f*ck is 50 Cents?\".\\nIn a 2009 interview with Rolling Stone, 50 Cent accused Jay-Z and his record company Roc-A-Fella Records of being unfair to Beanie Sigel because \"[Jay-Z] didn\\'t have their interests in mind, he was just doing what he had to do for himself.\" The rapper also stated that \"I don\\'t know him personally, [...] I tried to collaborate with him on the Freeway project ... What I did was Freeway went out and found his publishing deal, and we started the album. [...] when it came time to put the record out, he didn\\'t want to shoot his video. He has a god complex.\" 50 Cent also accused Jay-Z of changing in attitude and image since marrying Beyoncé.\\nIn 2017, 50 Cent described Jay-Z\\'s thirteenth studio album 4:44 as \"golf course music\" in a Instagram post, elaborating: \"I listened to Jay sh*t, that 4:44. [...] [It] was too smart. I felt like I was supposed to be wearing like glasses and shit and like a tie, a fucking sweater around my waist. It was like Ivy League. They don\\'t wanna hear that shit. [...] They just wanna have a good time. You know what I\\'m saying? You can\\'t be the best rapper at 47 because the new n****s is here. They coming with new [music] going on.\" In an interview on the Conan Show, 50 Cent spoke about the album, saying: \"Hip-hop culture\\'s connected to youth culture. The kids gonna bring new innovative stuff. He just had the maturity bleed off into the material. [...] But the kids, I don\\'t see them actually listening to it\".\\nIn an interview in 2022, 50 Cent reported that in a meeting between him and the couple in Los Angeles, the two rappers were having a heated argument. Beyoncé, seeing them, jumped from a ledge to come to her husband\\'s defense. 50 Cent compared the singer to her sister Solange when she hit Jay-Z in the elevator, describing them as \"two gangstas\".\\nIn an interview for XXL Mag in 2023, 50 Cent claimed that Jay-Z\\'s Grammy wins were due to his marriage to Beyoncé: \"Even Jay-Z\\'s career, you can look at that and say the association to Beyoncé is when he started to receive the 16, 17 Grammys, since he\\'s been with Beyoncé. And you go, prior to that [he had] one. That came with the association.\" 50 Cent also pointed out that the couple\\'s eldest child Blue Ivy Carter won a Grammy even though she does not sing or rap, accusing award ceremonies of giving accolades to the couple just to ensure their attendance during the show. The rapper also reported that his non-win at the Grammys was due to his music being \"a little bit abrasive to conservatives; [...] It didn\\'t matter to me in that time period. Don\\'t give me the trophy. They didn\\'t give me Best New Artist and I sold 13 million records\", while the Carter-Knowles family is more politically agreeable to the music industry.\\n\\nFat Joe\\nIn connection to his feud with Ja Rule, 50 Cent also took aim at fellow New York rapper Fat Joe, a high profile collaborator of Ja Rule\\'s. The feud took aim at Fat Joe following his 2002 track What\\'s Luv? featuring Ja Rule and Ashanti. Fat Joe had also continued his collaboration with Murder Inc. on his 2004 track \"New York\" featuring Jadakiss, prompting a diss track aimed at Fat Joe from 50 Cent on his 2005 album The Massacre entitled Piggy Bank. Fat Joe later responded with the track \"My Fofo\" on his album All or Nothing released later that same year. Tensions boiled over during the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards when Fat Joe presented the award for best Hip Hop Video, in which he told the audience \"I feel so safe tonight with all this police protection courtesy of G-Unit\". 50 Cent later retaliated with a profanity-laden diatribe following his performance of the song So Seductive with fellow G-Unit artist Tony Yayo, exclaiming \"Fat Joe\\'s a pussy man! [...] Pussy Boy, Nigga What?!\". The feud later affected Fat Joe financially as he sought to secure a $20 million contract endorsing Air Jordan sneakers in early 2005, Michael Jordan himself later cancelled the contract following the VMA incident as he was in fear of conflict with 50 Cent or any other affiliates. Following this; little action was taken on either side as the feud seemed to calm down by 2011. Murder Inc. executive Irv Gotti later expressed anger at Fat Joe following his proposal to quell their longstanding feud with G-Unit in 2010. In 2012; 50 Cent approached Fat Joe in talks of ending the feud following the two agreeing to perform at a memorial ceremony for then recently-deceased music executive Chris Lighty. Despite the prior history between the two, 50 Cent and Fat Joe became close friends and business associates shortly thereafter despite Fat Joe\\'s lengthy connections with Ja Rule.\\n\\nThe Game\\nAlthough Jackson was close to The Game before the latter released his debut album, The Documentary, they grew apart. After The Documentary\\'s release, Jackson felt that The Game was disloyal for saying that he did not want to participate in G-Unit\\'s feuds with other rappers (such as Nas, Jadakiss and Fat Joe) and his desire to work with artists with which G-Unit was feuding. He said that he wrote six songs for the album and did not receive proper credit, which The Game denied.\\n\\nJackson later dismissed The Game from G-Unit on Hot 97. After the announcement, The Game (a guest earlier in the evening) tried to enter the building with his entourage. After they were denied entry, one of his associates was shot in the leg in a confrontation with a group of men leaving the building. When the situation escalated, the rappers held a joint press conference announcing their reconciliation, and fans were uncertain if the rappers had staged a publicity stunt to boost sales of their recently released albums. After the situation cooled, G-Unit criticized The Game\\'s street credibility and announced that they would not appear on his albums. During a Summer Jam performance The Game announced a boycott of G-Unit, which he called \"G-Unot\".\\nAfter the Summer Jam performance The Game recorded \"300 Bars and Runnin\\'\", an extended \"diss\" of G-Unit and Roc-A-Fella Records, for the mixtape You Know What It Is Vol. 3. Jackson responded with his \"Piggy Bank\" music video, with The Game as Mr. Potato Head and parodies of other rivals. They have continued attacking each other, with The Game releasing two more mixtapes: Ghost Unit and a mixtape-DVD, Stop Snitchin, Stop Lyin. Jackson superimposed The Game\\'s head on the body of a male stripper for the cover of the Hate It or Love It (G-Unit Radio Part 21) mixtape in response to The Game\\'s pictures of G-Unit dressed as the Village People. The Game, under contract to Aftermath Entertainment, signed with Geffen Records to terminate his contractual obligations with G-Unit (although it is claimed that Jackson pressured Dr. Dre to fire him). G-Unit member Spider Loc has insulted The Game in songs, and the latter released \"240 Bars (Spider Joke)\" and \"100 Bars (The Funeral)\" attacking G-Unit and Loc. Jackson\\'s response was \"Not Rich, Still Lyin\\'\", mocking The Game. Lloyd Banks replied to the Game on a Rap City freestyle-booth segment, followed by a Game \"diss\" song (\"SoundScan\") ridiculing the 13-position drop of Banks\\' album Rotten Apple on the Billboard 200 chart and its disappointing second-week sales. Banks replied on his mixtape Mo\\' Money In The Bank Pt. 5: Gang Green Season Continues with \"Showtime (The Game\\'s Over)\", said that Jackson wrote half of The Documentary and ridiculed The Game\\'s suicidal thoughts.\\nIn October 2006, The Game made a peace overture (which was not immediately answered) to Jackson, but two days later he said on Power 106 that the peace offer was valid for only one day. In several songs on Doctor\\'s Advocate, he implied that the feud was over. He said in July 2009 that the feud had ended with help from Michael Jackson and Diddy, and apologized for his actions. According to Tony Yayo, neither Jackson nor G-Unit accepted his apology and The Game has resumed his calls for a \"G-Unot\" boycott at concerts. Jackson released \"So Disrespectful\" on Before I Self Destruct, targeting Jay-Z, The Game and Young Buck. The Game responded with \"Shake\", poking fun at the music video for Jackson\\'s \"Candy Shop\".\\nOn January 2, 2015, The Game claimed that he and 50 were \"sworn enemies\", promising never to reconcile with him anymore, but on August 1, 2016, they ended their twelve-year feud when the two were in the Ace of Diamonds strip club and The Game said \"I love 50, man. What happened, that shit was 12 years ago.\"\\nIn January 2022, the feud reiterated after 50 critiqued Game\\'s Drink Champs interview with N.O.R.E., where he claimed that 50\\'s former competitor Kanye West did \"more for me in two weeks than [Dr.] Dre did for me throughout my entire career\". The Game responded, commenting that he enclosed the entirety of G-Unit as a group and clothing brand \"in a casket\", also expressing his likeliness in the Power television trilogy, but warning 50 to \"leave [the past] alone or else... I\\'m outside #Numinati\". Then, two months later, in March, 50 Cent published a video via Instagram of Game being shunned by former Interscope Records CEO Jimmy Iovine at a basketball game, poking fun of it while also commenting \"50 wrote ya hits\". The Game once again flamed 50 after the claims were brought back up and also bragged to \"get [50\\'s] girlfriend out of my DM\\'s\". This was believed to have been a consequential result of Game claiming on Drink Champs to be \"the best and a better rapper\" than Eminem, with whom 50 still remains close friends. Additionally, Game\\'s manager, Wack 100, has subliminally called out or questioned 50 Cent\\'s credibility, over the rapper\\'s surprise appearance at the Super Bowl LVI halftime show and ghostwriting allegations.\\n\\nCam\\'ron\\nJackson\\'s issues with former The Diplomats member Cam\\'ron began in 2007, when they had a live argument on The Angie Martinez Show on Hot 97 radio. Jackson commented that he felt that the music division of Koch Entertainment (known today as MNRK Music Group) was a \"graveyard\", meaning major record labels would not work with their artists. Cam\\'ron then ridiculed the record sales of G-Unit members Lloyd Banks and Mobb Deep by pointing out that Dipset member Jim Jones outsold both of their albums despite not being signed to a major label, and also went on to clarify that his group, The Diplomats, had a distribution deal from several labels. Both rappers released diss songs with videos on YouTube. Jackson released \"Funeral Music\", and suggested in the song that Cam\\'ron is no longer able to lead The Diplomats and that Jim Jones should take his place. Cam\\'ron responded with \"Curtis\" and \"Curtis Pt. II\", in which he makes fun of not only Jackson\\'s first name, but also his appearance, calling him \"a gorilla, with rabbit teeth\". Jackson responded by releasing \"Hold On\" with Young Buck. Since 2009, the feud slowly died down, and they eventually reconciled in 2016.\\n\\nRick Ross\\nAlthough Rick Ross began a feud with Jackson over an alleged incident at the 2008 BET Hip Hop Awards, Jackson told news sources he did not remember seeing Ross there. Later that month Ross\\' \"Mafia Music\" was leaked on the Internet, with lyrics apparently disparaging Jackson. Several days later, Jackson released \"Officer Ricky (Go Head, Try Me)\" in response to \"Mafia Music\". The following day, Ross appeared on Shade 45 (Eminem\\'s Sirius channel) and told Jackson to come up with something better in 24 hours.\\nBefore leaving for Venezuela, Jackson uploaded a video (\"Warning Shot\") and the first of a series of \"Officer Ricky\" cartoons. In early February he uploaded a YouTube video in which he interviewed \"Tia\", the mother of one of Ross\\' children; according to her, Ross is in reality a correctional officer. On February 5, 2009, The Game phoned Seattle radio station KUBE. Asked about the dispute between Jackson and Ross, he sided with Jackson and offered to mediate: \"Rick Ross, holla at your boy, man\" and \"50 eating you, boy.\"\\nOn his album Deeper Than Rap, Ross refers to Jackson in \"In Cold Blood\" and Jackson\\'s mock funeral is part of the song\\'s video. When the song was released, Ross said that he ended Jackson\\'s career. \"Rick Ross is Albert From CB4. You ever seen the movie? He\\'s Albert,\" Jackson replied in an interview. \"It never gets worse than this. You get a guy that was a correctional officer come out and base his entire career on writing material from a drug dealer\\'s perspective such as \"Freeway\" Ricky Ross.\" Their feud rekindled at the 2012 BET Hip Hop Awards, where Jackson and G-Unit members Kidd Kidd, Mike Knox, Tony Yayo were seen on video attacking Gunplay (a member of Ross\\' Maybach Music Group). Gunplay\\'s Maybach Music diamond necklace was stolen during the brawl, and several days later Jackson appeared at a Washington, D.C. bowling alley wearing Gunplay\\'s chain. On January 30, 2013, Jackson tweeted that Ross\\' attempted drive-by shooting on his birthday three days earlier was \"staged\".\\n\\nAwards and nominations\\nDiscography\\nStudio albums\\n\\nGet Rich or Die Tryin\\' (2003)\\nThe Massacre (2005)\\nCurtis (2007)\\nBefore I Self Destruct (2009)\\nAnimal Ambition (2014)\\nCollaborative albums\\n\\nBeg for Mercy (with G-Unit) (2003)\\nT·O·S (Terminate on Sight) (with G-Unit) (2008)\\n\\nFilmography\\nFilm\\nTelevision\\nVideo games\\nIn popular culture\\nJackson\\'s stage name is lent to the female character, Isuzu Sento, in the Japanese light novel/manga/anime series, Amagi Brilliant Park.\\n\\nFootnote\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\n\\nOfficial website \\n50 Cent at AllMusic \\n50 Cent at IMDb',\n",
              " 'Andre Romell  Young (born February 18, 1965), known professionally as Dr. Dre, is an American record producer, rapper, record executive, and actor. He is the founder and CEO of Aftermath Entertainment and Beats Electronics, and co-founded and was the president of Death Row Records. Dre began his career as a member of the World Class Wreckin\\' Cru in 1984, and later found fame with the gangsta rap group N.W.A. The group popularized explicit lyrics in hip hop to detail the violence of street life. During the early 1990s, Dre was credited as a key figure in the crafting and popularization of West Coast G-funk, a subgenre of hip hop characterized by a synthesizer foundation and slow, heavy production.\\nReleased as Death Row\\'s first major project, Dr. Dre\\'s solo debut studio album, The Chronic (1992) made him one of the best-selling American music artists of 1993. It earned him a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance with the single \"Let Me Ride\", as well as several accolades for the single \"Nuthin\\' but a \\'G\\' Thang\" (featuring Snoop Dogg). That year, he produced Death Row labelmate Snoop Doggy Dogg\\'s debut album Doggystyle, and mentored producers such as his stepbrother Warren G (leading to the multi-platinum debut Regulate... G Funk Era in 1994) and Snoop Dogg\\'s cousin Daz Dillinger (leading to the double-platinum debut Dogg Food by Tha Dogg Pound in 1995), as he would mentor other producers including Mel-Man and Scott Storch. In 1996, Dre left Death Row Records to establish his own label, Aftermath Entertainment; his compilation album, Dr. Dre Presents: The Aftermath (1996) and second studio album, 2001 (1999) followed thereafter.\\nDuring the 2000s, Dr. Dre shifted focus onto production for other artists, occasionally contributing vocals. He signed Eminem in 1998 and 50 Cent in 2002, while extensively contributing to releases by both artists. Aftermath has since signed other artists including the Game, Kendrick Lamar, Anderson .Paak, Silk Sonic, Busta Rhymes, Eve, and Rakim, among others. He has won seven Grammy Awards, including Producer of the Year, Non-Classical. Rolling Stone ranked him number 56 on the list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Outside of music, Dre has acted in films such as Set It Off, The Wash, and Training Day.\\nAccusations of Dr. Dre\\'s violence against women have been widely publicized. Following his assault of television host Dee Barnes, he was fined US$2,500, given two years\\' probation, and ordered to perform 240 hours of community service, part of which he fulfilled by making an anti-violence public service announcement. A civil suit was settled out of court. In 2015, Michel\\'le, the mother of one of his children, accused him of domestic violence during their time together as a couple. The abusive relationship is portrayed in her 2016 biopic Surviving Compton: Dre, Suge & Michel\\'le. Lisa Johnson, the mother of three of Dre\\'s children, stated that he beat her many times, including while she was pregnant. She was granted a restraining order against him. Former labelmate Tairrie B claimed that Dre assaulted her at a party in 1990, in response to her track \"Ruthless Bitch\". Two weeks following the release of his third album, Compton in August 2015, he issued an apology to the women \"I\\'ve hurt\".\\n\\nEarly life\\nAndre Romell Young was born in Compton, California, on February 18, 1965, the son of Theodore and Verna Young. His middle name is derived from the Romells, his father\\'s amateur R&B group. His parents married in 1964, separated in 1968, and divorced in 1972. His mother later remarried to Curtis Crayon and had three children: sons Jerome and Tyree (both deceased) and daughter Shameka.\\nIn 1976, Dre began attending Vanguard Junior High School in Compton, but due to gang violence, he transferred to the safer suburban Roosevelt Junior High School. The family moved often and lived in apartments and houses in Compton, Carson, Long Beach, and the Watts and South Central neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Dre has said that he was mostly raised by his grandmother in the New Wilmington Arms housing project in Compton. His mother later married Warren Griffin, which added three step-sisters and one step-brother to the family; the latter would eventually begin rapping under the name Warren G. Dre is also the cousin of producer Sir Jinx.\\nDre attended Centennial High School in Compton during his freshman year in 1979, but transferred to Fremont High School in South Central Los Angeles due to poor grades. He attempted to enroll in an apprenticeship program at Northrop Aviation Company, but was ineligible due to poor grades. Thereafter, he focused on his social life and entertainment for the remainder of his high school years.\\nDre\\'s frequent absences from school jeopardized his position as a diver on his school\\'s swim team. After high school, he attended Chester Adult School in Compton following his mother\\'s demands for him to get a job or continue his education. After brief attendance at a radio broadcasting school, he relocated to the residence of his father and residence of his grandparents before returning to his mother\\'s house.\\n\\nMusical career\\n1985–1986: World Class Wreckin\\' Cru\\nInspired by the Grandmaster Flash song \"The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel\", Dr. Dre often attended a club called Eve\\'s After Dark to watch many DJs and rappers performing live. He subsequently became a DJ in the club, initially under the name \"Dr. J\", based on the nickname of Julius Erving, his favorite basketball player. At the club, he met aspiring rapper Antoine Carraby, later to become member DJ Yella of N.W.A. Soon afterwards he adopted the moniker Dr. Dre, a mix of previous alias Dr. J and his first name, referring to himself as the \"Master of Mixology\".\\nEve After Dark had a back room with a small four-track studio where Dre and Yella recorded several demos. In their first recording session, they recorded a song entitled \"Surgery\". Dr. Dre\\'s earliest recordings were released in 1994 on a compilation titled Concrete Roots. Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the compiled music, released \"several years before Dre developed a distinctive style\", as \"surprisingly generic and unengaging\" and \"for dedicated fans only\".\\nDre later joined the musical group World Class Wreckin\\' Cru, which released its debut album under the Kru-Cut label in 1985. The group would become stars of the electro-hop scene that dominated early-mid 1980s West Coast hip hop. \"Surgery\", which was officially released after being recorded prior to the group\\'s official formation, would prominently feature Dr. Dre on the turntable. The record would become the group\\'s first hit, selling 50,000 copies within the Compton area. Dr. Dre and DJ Yella also performed mixes for local radio station KDAY, boosting ratings for its afternoon rush-hour show The Traffic Jam.\\n\\n1986–1991: N.W.A and Ruthless Records\\nIn 1986, Dr. Dre met rapper O\\'Shea Jackson—known as Ice Cube—who collaborated with him to record songs for Ruthless Records, a hip hop record label run by local rapper Eazy-E. N.W.A and fellow West Coast rapper Ice-T are widely credited as seminal artists of the gangsta rap genre, a profanity-heavy subgenre of hip hop, replete with gritty depictions of urban crime and gang lifestyle. Not feeling constricted to racially charged political issues pioneered by rap artists such as Public Enemy or Boogie Down Productions, N.W.A favored themes and uncompromising lyrics, offering stark descriptions of violent, inner-city streets. Propelled by the hit \"Fuck tha Police\", the group\\'s first full album Straight Outta Compton became a major success, despite an almost complete absence of radio airplay or major concert tours. The Federal Bureau of Investigation sent Ruthless Records a warning letter in response to the song\\'s content.\\nAfter Ice Cube left N.W.A in 1989 over financial disputes, Dr. Dre produced and performed for much of the group\\'s second album Efil4zaggin. He also produced tracks for a number of other acts on Ruthless Records, including Eazy-E\\'s 1988 solo debut Eazy-Duz-It, Above the Law\\'s 1990 debut Livin\\' Like Hustlers, Michel\\'le\\'s 1989 self-titled debut, the D.O.C.\\'s 1989 debut No One Can Do It Better, J.J. Fad\\'s 1988 debut Supersonic and funk rock musician Jimmy Z\\'s 1991 album Muzical Madness.\\n\\n1991–1996: The Chronic and Death Row Records\\nAfter a dispute with Eazy-E, Dre left the group at the peak of its popularity in 1991 under the advice of friend, and N.W.A lyricist, the D.O.C. and his bodyguard at the time, Suge Knight. Knight, a notorious strongman and intimidator, was able to have Eazy-E release Young from his contract and, using Dr. Dre as his flagship artist, founded Death Row Records. In 1992, Young released his first single, the title track to the film Deep Cover, a collaboration with rapper Snoop Dogg, whom he met through Warren G. Dr. Dre\\'s debut solo album was The Chronic, released under Death Row Records with Suge Knight as executive producer. Young ushered in a new style of rap, both in terms of musical style and lyrical content, including introducing a number of artists to the industry including Snoop Dogg, Kurupt, Daz Dillinger, RBX, the Lady of Rage, Nate Dogg and Jewell.\\n\\nOn the strength of singles such as \"Nuthin\\' but a \\'G\\' Thang\", \"Let Me Ride\", and \"Fuck wit Dre Day (and Everybody\\'s Celebratin\\')\" (known as \"Dre Day\" for radio and television play), all of which featured Snoop Dogg as guest vocalist, The Chronic became a cultural phenomenon, its G-funk sound dominating much of hip hop music for the early 1990s. In 1993, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album triple platinum, and Dr. Dre also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance for his performance on \"Let Me Ride\". For that year, Billboard magazine also ranked Dr. Dre as the eighth-best-selling musical artist, The Chronic as the sixth-best-selling album, and \"Nuthin\\' but a \\'G\\' Thang\" as the 11th-best-selling single.\\n\\nBesides working on his own material, Dr. Dre produced Snoop Dogg\\'s debut album Doggystyle, which became the first debut album for an artist to enter the Billboard 200 album charts at number one. In 1994 Dr. Dre produced some songs on the soundtracks to the films Above the Rim and Murder Was the Case. He collaborated with fellow N.W.A member Ice Cube for the song \"Natural Born Killaz\" in 1995. For the film Friday, Dre recorded \"Keep Their Heads Ringin\\'\", which reached number ten on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 1 on the Hot Rap Singles (now Hot Rap Tracks) charts.\\nIn 1995, Death Row Records signed rapper 2Pac, and began to position him as their major star: he collaborated with Dr. Dre on the commercially successful single \"California Love\", which became both artists\\' first song to top the Billboard Hot 100. However, in March 1996 Young left the label amidst a contract dispute and growing concerns that label boss Suge Knight was corrupt, financially dishonest and out of control. Later that year, he formed his own label, Aftermath Entertainment, under the distribution label for Death Row Records, Interscope Records. Subsequently, Death Row Records suffered poor sales by 1997, especially following the death of 2Pac and the racketeering charges brought against Knight.\\nDr. Dre also appeared on the single \"No Diggity\" by R&B group Blackstreet in 1996: it too was a sales success, topping the Hot 100 for four consecutive weeks, and later won the award for Best R&B Vocal by a Duo or Group at the 1997 Grammy Awards. After hearing it for the first time, several of Dr. Dre\\'s former Death Row colleagues, including 2Pac, recorded and attempted to release a song titled \"Toss It Up\", containing numerous insults aimed at Dr. Dre and using a deliberately similar instrumental to \"No Diggity\", but were forced to replace the production after Blackstreet issued the label with a cease and desist order stopping them from distributing the song.\\n\\n1996–2000: Move to Aftermath Entertainment and 2001\\nThe Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath album, released on November 26, 1996, featured songs by Dr. Dre himself, as well as by newly signed Aftermath Entertainment artists, and a solo track \"Been There, Done That\", intended as a symbolic farewell to gangsta rap. Despite being certified platinum by the RIAA, the album was not very popular among music fans. In October 1996, Dre performed \"Been There, Done That\" on Saturday Night Live. In 1997, Dr. Dre produced several tracks on the Firm\\'s The Album; it was met with largely negative reviews from critics. Rumors began to abound that Aftermath was facing financial difficulties. Aftermath Entertainment also faced a trademark infringement lawsuit by the underground thrash metal band Aftermath.\\nFirst Round Knock Out, a compilation of various tracks produced and performed by Dr. Dre, was also released in 1996, with material ranging from World Class Wreckin\\' Cru to N.W.A to Death Row recordings. Dr. Dre chose to take no part in the ongoing East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry of the time, instead producing for, and appearing on, several New York artists\\' releases, such as Nas\\' \"Nas Is Coming\", LL Cool J\\'s \"Zoom\" and Jay-Z\\'s \"Watch Me\".\\nThe turning point for Aftermath came in 1998, when Dre\\'s close friend, Jimmy Iovine, the co-founder of Interscope Records (parent label for Aftermath), suggested that Dr. Dre sign Eminem, a white rapper from Detroit. Dre produced three songs and provided vocals for two on Eminem\\'s successful and controversial debut album The Slim Shady LP, released in 1999. The Dr. Dre-produced lead single from that album, \"My Name Is\", brought Eminem to public attention for the first time, and the success of The Slim Shady LP – it reached number two on the Billboard 200 and received general acclaim from critics – revived the label\\'s commercial ambitions and viability.\\n\\nDr. Dre\\'s second solo album, 2001, released on November 16, 1999, was considered an ostentatious return to his gangsta rap roots. It was initially titled The Chronic 2000 to imply being a sequel to his debut solo effort The Chronic but was re-titled 2001 after Death Row Records released an unrelated compilation album with the title Suge Knight Represents: Chronic 2000 in May 1999. Other tentative titles included The Chronic 2001 and Dr. Dre.\\nThe album featured numerous collaborators, including Devin the Dude, Snoop Dogg, Kurupt, Xzibit, Nate Dogg, Eminem, Knoc-turn\\'al, King T, Defari, Kokane, Mary J. Blige and new protégé Hittman, as well as co-production between Dre and new Aftermath producer Mel-Man. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of the website AllMusic described the sound of the album as \"adding ominous strings, soulful vocals, and reggae\" to Dr. Dre\\'s style. The album was highly successful, charting at number two on the Billboard 200 charts and has since been certified six times platinum, validating a recurring theme on the album: Dr. Dre was still a force to be reckoned with, despite the lack of major releases in the previous few years. The album included popular hit singles \"Still D.R.E.\" and \"Forgot About Dre\", both of which Dr. Dre performed on NBC\\'s Saturday Night Live on October 23, 1999. Dr. Dre won the Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical in 2000, and joined the Up in Smoke Tour with fellow rappers Eminem, Snoop Dogg, and Ice Cube that year as well.\\n\\n2000–2010: Focus on production and Detox\\nFollowing the success of 2001, Dr. Dre focused on producing songs and albums for other artists. He co-produced six tracks on Eminem\\'s landmark Marshall Mathers LP, including the Grammy-winning lead single, \"The Real Slim Shady\". The album itself earned a Grammy and proved to be the fastest-selling rap album of all time, moving 1.76 million units in its first week alone. He produced the single \"Family Affair\" by R&B singer Mary J. Blige for her album No More Drama in 2001. He also produced \"Let Me Blow Ya Mind\", a duet by rapper Eve and No Doubt lead singer Gwen Stefani and signed R&B singer Truth Hurts to Aftermath in 2001.\\nDr. Dre produced and rapped on singer and Interscope labelmate Bilal\\'s 2001 single \"Fast Lane\", which barely missed the Top 40 of the R&B charts. He later assisted in the production of Bilal\\'s second album, Love for Sale, which Interscope controversially shelved because of its creative direction. Dr. Dre was the executive producer of Eminem\\'s 2002 release, The Eminem Show. He produced three songs on the album, one of which was released as a single, and he appeared in the award-winning video for \"Without Me\". He also produced the D.O.C.\\'s 2003 album Deuce, where he made a guest appearance on the tracks \"Psychic Pymp Hotline\", \"Gorilla Pympin\\'\" and \"Judgment Day\".\\nIn 2002, Dr. Dre signed rapper 50 Cent to Aftermath in a joint venture between Interscope and Eminem\\'s Shady Records. Dr. Dre served as executive producer for 50 Cent\\'s commercially successful February 2003 debut studio album Get Rich or Die Tryin\\'. Dr. Dre produced or co-produced four tracks on the album, including the hit single \"In da Club\". Eminem\\'s fourth album since joining Aftermath, Encore, again saw Dre taking on the role of executive producer, and this time he was more actively involved in the music, producing or co-producing a total of eight tracks, including three singles.\\nDr. Dre also produced \"How We Do\", a 2005 hit single from rapper the Game from his album The Documentary, as well as tracks on 50 Cent\\'s successful second album The Massacre. For an issue of Rolling Stone magazine in April 2005, Dr. Dre was ranked 54th out of 100 artists for Rolling Stone magazine\\'s list \"The Immortals: The Greatest Artists of All Time\". Kanye West wrote the summary for Dr. Dre, where he stated Dr. Dre\\'s song \"Xxplosive\" as where he \"got (his) whole sound from\".\\nIn November 2006, Dr. Dre began working with Raekwon on his album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx II. He also produced tracks for the rap albums Buck the World by Young Buck, Curtis by 50 Cent, Tha Blue Carpet Treatment by Snoop Dogg, and Kingdom Come by Jay-Z. Dre also appeared on Timbaland\\'s track \"Bounce\", from his 2007 solo album, Timbaland Presents Shock Value alongside, Missy Elliott, and Justin Timberlake. During this period, the D.O.C. stated that Dre had been working with him on his fourth album Voices through Hot Vessels, which he planned to release after Detox arrived.\\nPlanned but unreleased albums during Dr. Dre\\'s tenure at Aftermath have included a full-length reunion with Snoop Dogg titled Breakup to Makeup, an album with fellow former N.W.A member Ice Cube which was to be titled Heltah Skeltah, an N.W.A reunion album, and a joint album with fellow producer Timbaland titled Chairmen of the Board.\\nIn 2007, Dr. Dre\\'s third studio album, formerly known as Detox, was slated to be his final studio album. Work for the upcoming album dates back to 2001, where its first version was called \"the most advanced rap album ever\", by producer Scott Storch. Later that same year, he decided to stop working on the album to focus on producing for other artists, but then changed his mind; the album had initially been set for a fall 2005 release. Producers confirmed to work on the album include DJ Khalil, Nottz, Bernard \"Focus\" Edwards Jr., Hi-Tek, J.R. Rotem, RZA, and Jay-Z.  Snoop Dogg claimed that Detox was finished, according to a June 2008 report by Rolling Stone magazine.\\nAfter another delay based on producing other artists\\' work, Detox was then scheduled for a 2010 release, coming after 50 Cent\\'s Before I Self Destruct and Eminem\\'s Relapse, an album for which Dr. Dre handled the bulk of production duties. In a Dr Pepper commercial that debuted on May 28, 2009, he premiered the first official snippet of Detox. 50 Cent and Eminem asserted in a 2009 interview on BET\\'s 106 & Park that Dr. Dre had around a dozen songs finished for Detox.\\nOn December 15, 2008, Dre appeared in the remix of the song \"Set It Off\" by Canadian rapper Kardinal Offishall (also with Pusha T); the remix debuted on DJ Skee\\'s radio show. At the beginning of 2009, Dre produced, and made a guest vocal performance on, the single \"Crack a Bottle\" by Eminem and the single sold a record 418,000 downloads in its first week and reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart on the week of February 12, 2009. Along with this single, in 2009 Dr. Dre produced or co-produced 19 of 20 tracks on Eminem\\'s album Relapse. These included other hit singles \"We Made You\", \"Old Time\\'s Sake\", and \"3 a.m.\" (The only track Dre did not produce was the Eminem-produced single \"Beautiful\".).\\nOn April 20, 2010, \"Under Pressure\", featuring Jay-Z and co-produced with Scott Storch, was confirmed by Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre during an interview at Fenway Park as the album\\'s first single. The song leaked prior to its intended release in an unmixed, unmastered form without a chorus on June 16, 2010; however, critical reaction to the song was lukewarm, and Dr. Dre later announced in an interview that the song, along with any other previously leaked tracks from Detox\\'s recording process, would not appear on the final version of the album.\\nTwo genuine singles – \"Kush\", a collaboration with Snoop Dogg and fellow rapper Akon, and \"I Need a Doctor\" with Eminem and singer Skylar Grey – were released in the United States during November 2010 and February 2011 respectively: the latter achieved international chart success, reaching number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and later being certified double platinum by the RIAA and the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). On June 25, 2010, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers honored Dr. Dre with its Founders Award for inspiring other musicians.\\n\\n2010–2020: The Planets, hiatus, Coachella, and Compton\\nIn an August 2010 interview, Dr. Dre stated that an instrumental album, The Planets, was in its first stages of production; each song being named after a planet in the Solar System. On September 3, Dr. Dre showed support to longtime protégé Eminem, and appeared on his and Jay-Z\\'s Home & Home Tour, performing hit songs such as \"Still D.R.E.\", \"Nuthin\\' but a \\'G\\' Thang\", and \"Crack a Bottle\", alongside Eminem and another protégé, 50 Cent. Sporting an \"R.I.P. Proof\" shirt, Dre was honored by Eminem telling Detroit\\'s Comerica Park to do the same. They did so, by chanting \"DEEE-TOX\", to which he replied, \"I\\'m coming!\"\\nOn November 14, 2011, Dre announced that he would be taking a break from music after he finished producing for artists Slim the Mobster and Kendrick Lamar. In this break, he stated that he would \"work on bringing his Beats By Dre to a standard as high as Apple\" and would also spend time with his family. On January 9, 2012, Dre headlined the final nights of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2012.\\nIn June 2014, Marsha Ambrosius stated that she had been working on Detox, but added that the album would be known under another title . In September 2014, Aftermath in-house producer Dawaun Parker confirmed the title change and stated that over 300 beats had been created for the album over the years, but few of them have had vocals recorded over them.\\nThe length of time that Detox had been recorded for, as well as the limited amount of material that had been officially released or leaked from the recording sessions, had given it considerable notoriety within the music industry. Numerous release dates (including the ones mentioned above) had been given for the album over the years since it was first announced, although none of them transpired to be genuine. Several musicians closely affiliated with Dr. Dre, including Snoop Dogg, fellow rappers 50 Cent, the Game and producer DJ Quik, had speculated in interviews that the album will never be released, due to Dr. Dre\\'s business and entrepreneurial ventures having interfered with recording work, as well as causing him to lose motivation to record new material.\\nOn August 1, 2015, Dre announced that he would release what would be his final album, titled Compton. It is inspired by the N.W.A biopic, Straight Outta Compton, and is a compilation-style album, featuring a number of frequent collaborators, including Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar, Xzibit and the Game, among others. It was initially released on Apple Music on August 7, with a retail version releasing on August 21. In an interview with Rolling Stone, he revealed that he had about 20 to 40 tracks for Detox but he did not release it because it did not meet his standards. Dre also revealed that he suffers from social anxiety and due to this, remains secluded and out of attention.\\nOn February 12, 2016, it was revealed that Apple would create its first original scripted television series for its then-upcoming Apple TV+ streaming service. Titled Vital Signs, it was set to reflect Dre\\'s life. He was also  an executive producer on the show before the show\\'s cancellation sometime in September 2018, due to an overly graphic concept of drugs, gun violence and sex. In October 2016, Sean Combs brought out Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and others on his Bad Boy reunion tour.\\nIn 2018, he produced four songs on Oxnard by Anderson .Paak. He was the executive producer on the album, as so its follow-up, 2019\\'s Ventura.\\n\\n2020–present: return to production and Super Bowl halftime show\\nDr. Dre was the executive producer of Eminem\\'s 2020 release, Music to Be Murdered By. He produced four songs on the album. He also produced two songs on the deluxe edition of the album, Side B, and appeared on the song, \"Gunz Blazing\". On September 30, 2021, it was revealed that Dre would perform at the Super Bowl LVI halftime show alongside Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, and Kendrick Lamar. \\nIn December 2021, an update for the video game, Grand Theft Auto Online, predominantly featured Dre and added some of his previously unreleased tracks which was released as an EP, The Contract, on February 3, 2022. Around this time, Dre announced he was collaborating with Marsha Ambrosius on Casablanco, and with Mary J. Blige on an upcoming album. Later that year, Snoop Dogg announced that he and Dr. Dre are in the process of recording their new album, Missionary. Snoop said the album will be released via Death Row and Aftermath. \\nOn February 13, 2022, Dr. Dre performed at the Super Bowl LVI halftime show alongside Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar, and Mary J. Blige, with surprise appearances from 50 Cent and Anderson. Paak. The performance was met with critical acclaim and is the first Super Bowl halftime show to win the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Live). The show also won the Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Production Design for a Variety Special and Outstanding Music Direction. The same year, he produced numerous songs including \"The King and I\", a collaboration between Eminem and CeeLo Green for the 2022 biopic, Elvis, and a remix of Kanye West\\'s song \"Use This Gospel\" for DJ Khaled\\'s album God Did. \\nIn September 2022, it was reported that Dr. Dre will compose the original score for the upcoming animated series, Death for Hire: The Origin of Tehk City. The show is created by Ice-T and Arabian Prince; based on the graphic novel of the same title, it features the voice talent of Ice-T, his wife Coco Austin, Snoop Dogg, Busta Rhymes, and Treach among others.\\nIn February 2023, Dre and Marsha Ambrosius held a listening party for the Casablanco album in Los Angeles.\\n\\nOther ventures\\nFilm appearances\\nDr. Dre made his first on screen appearance as a weapons dealer in the 1996 bank robbery movie Set It Off. In 2001, Dr. Dre also appeared in the movies The Wash and Training Day. A song of his, \"Bad Intentions\" (featuring Knoc-Turn\\'Al and produced by Mahogany), was featured on The Wash soundtrack. Dr. Dre also appeared on two other songs \"On the Blvd.\" and \"The Wash\" along with his co-star Snoop Dogg.\\n\\nCrucial Films\\nIn February 2007, it was announced that Dr. Dre would produce dark comedies and horror films for New Line Cinema-owned company Crucial Films, along with longtime video director Phillip Atwell. Dr. Dre announced \"This is a natural switch for me, since I\\'ve directed a lot of music videos, and I eventually want to get into directing.\" Along with fellow member Ice Cube, Dr. Dre produced Straight Outta Compton (2015), a biographical film about N.W.A.\\n\\nEntrepreneurship\\nBeats Electronics\\nIn 2006, Dre co-founded Beats Electronics with his partner, Jimmy Iovine. Its first brand of headphones were launched in July 2008. The line consisted of Beats Studio, a circumaural headphone; Beats Tour, an in-ear headphone; Beats Solo & Solo HD, a supra-aural headphone; Beats Spin; Heartbeats by Lady Gaga, also an in-ear headphone; and Diddy Beats. In late 2009, Hewlett-Packard participated in a deal to bundle Beats By Dr. Dre with some HP laptops and headsets. HP and Dr. Dre announced the deal on October 9, 2009, at a press event. An exclusive laptop, known as the HP ENVY 15 Beats limited edition, was released for sale October 22. In January 2014, Beats Music was introduced and launched as a streaming service. Then, in May, technology giant Apple purchased the Beats brand for $3.4 billion. The deal made Dr. Dre the \"richest man in hip hop\". Dr. Dre became an Apple employee in an executive role, and worked with Apple for years. As of 2022, it was found that Apple had subtracted $200 million from the deal after entertainer Tyrese Gibson revealed the news of the acquisition on social media a month before it was completed without the company\\'s permission.\\n\\nPhilanthropy\\nDuring May 2013, Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine donated a $70-million endowment to the University of Southern California to create the USC Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation. The goal of the academy has been stated as \"to shape the future by nurturing the talents, passions, leadership and risk-taking of uniquely qualified students who are motivated to explore and create new art forms, technologies, and business models.\" The first class of the academy began in September 2014.\\nIn June 2017, it was announced that Dr. Dre had committed $10 million to the construction of a performing arts center for the new Compton High School. The center will encompass creative resources and a 1,200-seat theater, and is expected to break ground in 2020. The project is a partnership between Dr. Dre and the Compton Unified School District.\\n\\nCommercial endorsements\\nIn 2002 and 2003, Dr. Dre appeared in TV commercials for Coors Light beer.\\nBeginning in 2009, Dr. Dre appeared in TV commercials that also featured his Beats Electronics product line. A 2009  commercial for the Dr Pepper soft drink had Dr. Dre DJing with Beats headphones and playing a brief snippet off the never-released Detox album. In 2010, Dr. Dre had a cameo in a commercial for HP laptops that featured a plug for Beats Audio. Then in 2011, the Chrysler 300S \"Imported from Detroit\" ad campaign had a commercial narrated by Dr. Dre and including a plug for Beats Audio.\\n\\nDr. Dre started Burning Man rumors\\nAn urban legend surfaced in 2011 when a Tumblr blog titled Dr. Dre Started Burning Man began promulgating the notion that the producer, rapper and entrepreneur had discovered Burning Man in 1995 during a music video shoot and offered to cover the cost of the event\\'s permit from the Nevada Bureau of Land Management under an agreement with the festival\\'s organizers that he could institute an entrance fee system, which had not existed before his participation. This claim was supported by an alleged letter from Dre to Nicole Threatt Young that indicated that Dre had shared his experience witnessing the Burning Man festival with her.\\nBusiness Insider mentions the portion of the letter where Dr. Dre purportedly states \"someone should get behind this ... and make some money off these fools\" and compares Dr. Dre\\'s potential entrepreneurial engagement with Burning Man as a parallel to Steve Jobs\\'s efforts to centralize and profit from the otherwise unorganized online music industry. According to Salon, Dr. Dre\\'s ethos seems to be aligned with seven of the ten principles of the Burning Man community: \"radical self-reliance, radical self-expression, communal effort, civic responsibility, leaving no trace, participation and immediacy.\"\\n\\nMusical influences and style\\nThe space, about the size of a college dorm room, is splattered with papers, ideas scribbled down in black ink. Nuthin\\' but G thangs waiting to happen. Those that don\\'t happen end up in a round, purple L.A. Lakers trash can. A kitchen, red and stainless steel like a \\'50s diner, adjoins the control room\\n\\nProduction style\\nDre is noted for his evolving production style, while always keeping in touch with his early musical sound and re-shaping elements from previous work. At the beginning of his career as a producer for the World Class Wreckin Cru with DJ Alonzo Williams in the mid-1980s, his music was in the electro-hop style pioneered by the Unknown DJ, and that of early hip-hop groups like the Beastie Boys and Whodini.\\nFrom Straight Outta Compton on, Dre uses live musicians to replay old melodies rather than sampling them. With Ruthless Records, collaborators included guitarist Mike \"Crazy Neck\" Sims, multi-instrumentalist Colin Wolfe, DJ Yella and sound engineer Donovan \"The Dirt Biker\" Sound. Dre is receptive of new ideas from other producers, one example being his fruitful collaboration with Above the Law\\'s producer Cold 187um while at Ruthless. Cold 187 um was at the time experimenting with 1970s P-Funk samples (Parliament, Funkadelic, Bootsy Collins, George Clinton etc.), that Dre also used. Dre has since been accused of \"stealing\" the concept of G-funk from Cold 187 um.\\nUpon leaving Ruthless and forming Death Row Records in 1991, Dre called on veteran West Coast DJ Chris \"the Glove\" Taylor and sound engineer Greg \"Gregski\" Royal, along with Colin Wolfe, to help him on future projects. His 1992 album The Chronic is thought to be one of the most well-produced hip-hop albums of all time. Musical themes included hard-hitting synthesizer solos played by Wolfe, bass-heavy compositions, background female vocals and Dre fully embracing 1970s funk samples. Dre used a minimoog synth to replay the melody from Leon Haywood\\'s 1972 song \"I Wanna Do Somethin\\' Freaky to You\" for the Chronic\\'s first single \"Nuthin\\' but a \\'G\\' Thang\" which became a global hit. For his new protégé Snoop Doggy Dogg\\'s album Doggystyle, Dre collaborated with then 19-year-old producer Daz Dillinger, who received co-production credits on songs \"Serial Killa\" and \"For all My Niggaz & Bitches\", The Dramatics bass player Tony \"T. Money\" Green, guitarist Ricky Rouse, keyboardists Emanuel \"Porkchop\" Dean and Sean \"Barney Rubble\" Thomas and engineer Tommy Daugherty, as well as Warren G and Sam Sneed, who are credited with bringing several samples to the studio.\\nThe influence of The Chronic and Doggystyle on the popular music of the 1990s went not only far beyond the West Coast, but beyond hip-hop as a genre. Artists as diverse as Master P (\"Bout It, Bout It\"), George Michael (\"Fastlove\"), Mariah Carey (\"Fantasy\"), Adina Howard (\"Freak Like Me\"), Luis Miguel (\"Dame\"), and The Spice Girls (\"Say You\\'ll Be There\") used G-funk instrumentation in their songs. Bad Boy Records producer Chucky Thompson stated in the April 2004 issue of XXL magazine that the sound of Doggystyle and The Chronic was the basis for the Notorious B.I.G.\\'s 1995 hit single \"Big Poppa\":\\n\\nAt that time, we were listening to Snoop\\'s album. We knew what was going on in the West through Dr. Dre. Big just knew the culture, he knew what was going on with hip-hop. It was more than just New York, it was all over.\\nIn 1994, starting with the Murder was the Case soundtrack, Dre attempted to push the boundaries of G-funk further into a darker sound. In songs such as \"Murder was the Case\" and \"Natural Born Killaz\", the synthesizer pitch is higher and the drum tempo is slowed down to 91 BPM (87 BPM in the remix) to create a dark and gritty atmosphere. Percussion instruments, particularly sleigh bells, are also present. Dre\\'s frequent collaborators from this period included Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania natives Stuart \"Stu-B-Doo\" Bullard, a multi-instrumentalist from the Ozanam Strings Orchestra, Sam Sneed, Stephen \"Bud\\'da\" Anderson, and percussionist Carl \"Butch\" Small. This style of production has been influential far beyond the West Coast. The beat for the Houston-based group Geto Boys 1996 song \"Still\" follows the same drum pattern as \"Natural Born Killaz\" and Eazy E\\'s \"Wut Would U Do\" (a diss to Dre) is similar to the original \"Murder was the Case\" instrumental. This style of production is usually accompanied by horror and occult-themed lyrics and imagery, being crucial to the creation of horrorcore.\\nBy 1996, Dre was again looking to innovate his sound. He recruited keyboardist Camara Kambon to play the keys on \"Been There, Done That\", and through Bud\\'da and Sam Sneed he was introduced to fellow Pittsburgh native Melvin \"Mel-Man\" Bradford. At this time, he also switched from using the E-mu SP-1200 to the Akai MPC3000 drum kit and sampler, which he still uses today. Beginning with his 1996 compilation Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath, Dre\\'s production has taken a less sample-based approach, with loud, layered snare drums dominating the mix, while synthesizers are still omnipresent. In his critically acclaimed second album, 2001, live instrumentation takes the place of sampling, a famous example being \"The Next Episode\", in which keyboardist Camara Kambon re-played live the main melody from David McCallum\\'s 1967 jazz-funk work \"The Edge\". For every song on 2001, Dre had a keyboardist, guitarist and bassist create the basic parts of the beat, while he himself programmed the drums, did the sequencing and overdubbing and added sound effects, and later mixed the songs. During this period, Dre\\'s signature \"west coast whistle\" riffs are still present albeit in a lower pitch, as in \"Light Speed\", \"Housewife\", \"Some L.A. Niggaz\" and Eminem\\'s \"Guilty Conscience\" hook. The sound of \"2001\" had tremendous influence on hip-hop production, redefining the West Coast\\'s sound and expanding the G-funk of the early 1990s. To produce the album, Dre and Mel-Man relied on the talents of Scott Storch and Camara Kambon on the keys, Mike Elizondo and Colin Wolfe on bass guitar, Sean Cruse on lead guitar and sound engineers Richard \"Segal\" Huredia and Mauricio \"Veto\" Iragorri.\\nFrom the mid-2000s, Dr. Dre has taken on a more soulful production style, using more of a classical piano instead of a keyboard, and having claps replace snares, as evidenced in songs such as Snoop Dogg\\'s \"Imagine\" and \"Boss\\' Life\", Busta Rhymes\\' \"Get You Some\" and \"Been Through the Storm\", Stat Quo\\'s \"Get Low\" and \"The Way It Be\", Jay-Z\\'s \"Lost One\", Nas\\' \"Hustlers\", and several beats on Eminem\\'s Relapse album. Soul and R&B pianist Mark Batson, having previously worked with The Dave Matthews Band, Seal and Maroon 5 has been credited as the architect of this sound. Besides Batson, Aftermath producer and understudy of Dre\\'s, Dawaun Parker, who has named Q-Tip and J Dilla as his primary influences, is thought to be responsible for giving Dre\\'s newest beats an East Coast feel.\\nDespite an occasional hint of trap about the beats and an intriguingly warped use of autotune in his Compton song, \"Darkside/Gone\", his production seems to stand slightly apart from current trends in hip-hop like Eminem\\'s song \"Little Engine\" with an ominous horrorcore beat — reminiscent of some of his works on Eminem\\'s album Relapse – or the West Coast joint Lock It Up.\\n\\nProduction equipment\\nDr. Dre has said that his primary instrument in the studio is the Akai MPC3000, a drum machine and sampler, and that he often uses as many as four or five to produce a single recording. He cites 1970s funk musicians such as George Clinton, Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield as his primary musical influences. Unlike most rap producers, he tries to avoid samples as much as possible, preferring to have studio musicians re-play pieces of music he wants to use, because it allows him more flexibility to change the pieces in rhythm and tempo. In 2001 he told Time magazine, \"I may hear something I like on an old record that may inspire me, but I\\'d rather use musicians to re-create the sound or elaborate on it. I can control it better.\"\\nOther equipment he uses includes the E-mu SP-1200 drum machine and other keyboards from such manufacturers as Korg, Rhodes, Wurlitzer, Moog, and Roland. Dr. Dre also stresses the importance of equalizing drums properly, telling Scratch in 2004 that he \"used the same drum sounds on a couple of different songs on one album before but you\\'d never be able to tell the difference because of the EQ\".  Dr. Dre also uses the digital audio workstation Pro Tools and uses the software to combine hardware drum machines and vintage analog keyboards and synthesizers.\\nAfter founding Aftermath Entertainment in 1996, Dr. Dre took on producer Mel-Man as a co-producer, and his music took on a more synthesizer-based sound, using fewer vocal samples (as he had used on \"Lil\\' Ghetto Boy\" and \"Let Me Ride\" on The Chronic, for example). Mel-Man has not shared co-production credits with Dr. Dre since approximately 2002, but fellow Aftermath producer Focus has credited Mel-Man as a key architect of the signature Aftermath sound.\\nIn 1999, Dr. Dre started working with Mike Elizondo, a bassist, guitarist, and keyboardist who has also produced, written and played on records for female singers such as Poe, Fiona Apple and Alanis Morissette, In the past few years Elizondo has since worked for many of Dr. Dre\\'s productions. Dr. Dre also told Scratch magazine in a 2004 interview that he has been studying piano and music theory formally, and that a major goal is to accumulate enough musical theory to score movies. In the same interview he stated that he has collaborated with famed 1960s songwriter Burt Bacharach by sending him hip hop beats to play over, and hopes to have an in-person collaboration with him in the future.\\n\\nWork ethic\\nDr. Dre has stated that he is a perfectionist and is known to pressure the artists with whom he records to give flawless performances. In 2006, Snoop Dogg told the website Dubcnn.com that Dr. Dre had made new artist Bishop Lamont re-record a single bar of vocals 107 times. Dr. Dre has also stated that Eminem is a fellow perfectionist, and attributes his success on Aftermath to his similar work ethic. He gives a lot of input into the delivery of the vocals and will stop an MC during a take if it is not to his liking. However, he gives MCs that he works with room to write lyrics without too much instruction unless it is a specifically conceptual record, as noted by Bishop Lamont in the book How to Rap.\\nA consequence of his perfectionism is that some artists who initially sign deals with Dr. Dre\\'s Aftermath label never release albums. In 2001, Aftermath released the soundtrack to the movie The Wash, featuring a number of Aftermath acts such as Shaunta, Daks, Joe Beast and Toi. To date, none have released full-length albums on Aftermath and have apparently ended their relationships with the label and Dr. Dre. Other noteworthy acts to leave Aftermath without releasing albums include King Tee, 2001 vocalist Hittman, Joell Ortiz, Raekwon and Rakim.\\n\\nCollaborators and co-producers\\nOver the years, word of other collaborators who have contributed to Dr. Dre\\'s work has surfaced. During his tenure at Death Row Records, it was alleged that Dr. Dre\\'s stepbrother Warren G and Tha Dogg Pound member Daz made many uncredited contributions to songs on his solo album The Chronic and Snoop Doggy Dogg\\'s album Doggystyle (Daz received production credits on Snoop\\'s similar-sounding, albeit less successful album Tha Doggfather after Young left Death Row Records).\\nIt is known that Scott Storch, who has since gone on to become a successful producer in his own right, contributed to Dr. Dre\\'s second album 2001; Storch is credited as a songwriter on several songs and played keyboards on several tracks. In 2006 he told Rolling Stone:\\n\\n\"At the time, I saw Dr. Dre desperately needed something,\" Storch says. \"He needed a fuel injection, and Dr. Dre utilized me as the nitrous oxide. He threw me into the mix, and I sort of tapped on a new flavor with my whole piano sound and the strings and orchestration. So I\\'d be on the keyboards, and Mike [Elizondo] was on the bass guitar, and Dr. Dre was on the drum machine\".\\nCurrent collaborator Mike Elizondo, when speaking about his work with Young, describes their recording process as a collaborative effort involving several musicians. In 2004 he claimed to Songwriter Universe magazine that he had written the foundations of the hit Eminem song \"The Real Slim Shady\", stating, \"I initially played a bass line on the song, and Dr. Dre, Tommy Coster Jr. and I built the track from there. Eminem then heard the track, and he wrote the rap to it.\" This account is essentially confirmed by Eminem in his book Angry Blonde, stating that the tune for the song was composed by a studio bassist and keyboardist while Dr. Dre was out of the studio but Young later programmed the song\\'s beat after returning.\\nA group of disgruntled former associates of Dr. Dre complained that they had not received their full due for work on the label in the September 2003 issue of The Source. A producer named Neff-U claimed to have produced the songs \"Say What You Say\" and \"My Dad\\'s Gone Crazy\" on The Eminem Show, the songs \"If I Can\\'t\" and \"Back Down\" on 50 Cent\\'s Get Rich or Die Tryin\\', and the beat featured on Dr. Dre\\'s commercial for Coors beer.\\nAlthough Young studies piano and music theory, he serves as more of a conductor than a musician himself, as Josh Tyrangiel of Time magazine has noted:\\n\\nEvery Dre track begins the same way, with Dre behind a drum machine in a room full of trusted musicians. (They carry beepers. When he wants to work, they work.) He\\'ll program a beat, then ask the musicians to play along; when Dre hears something he likes, he isolates the player and tells him how to refine the sound. \"My greatest talent,\" Dre says, \"is knowing exactly what I want to hear.\"\\nAlthough Snoop Dogg retains working relationships with Warren G and Daz, who are alleged to be uncredited contributors on the hit albums The Chronic and Doggystyle, he states that Dr. Dre is capable of making beats without the help of collaborators, and that he is responsible for the success of his numerous albums. Dr. Dre\\'s prominent studio collaborators, including Scott Storch, Elizondo, Mark Batson and Dawaun Parker, have shared co-writing, instrumental, and more recently co-production credits on the songs where he is credited as the producer.\\nAnderson .Paak also praised Dr. Dre in a 2016 interview with Music Times, telling the publication that it was a dream come true to work with Dre.\\n\\nGhostwriters\\nIt is acknowledged that most of Dr. Dre\\'s raps are written for him by others, though he retains ultimate control over his lyrics and the themes of his songs. As Aftermath producer Mahogany told Scratch: \"It\\'s like a class room in [the booth]. He\\'ll have three writers in there. They\\'ll bring in something, he\\'ll recite it, then he\\'ll say, \\'Change this line, change this word,\\' like he\\'s grading papers.\"\\nAs seen in the credits for tracks Young has appeared on, there are often multiple people who contribute to his songs (although often in hip hop many people are officially credited as a writer for a song, even the producer).\\nIn the book How to Rap, RBX explains that writing The Chronic was a \"team effort\" and details how he ghostwrote \"Let Me Ride\" for Dre. In regard to ghostwriting lyrics he says, \"Dre doesn\\'t profess to be no super-duper rap dude – Dre is a super-duper producer\". As a member of N.W.A, the D.O.C. wrote lyrics for him while he stuck with producing. Jay-Z ghostwrote lyrics for the single \"Still D.R.E.\" from Dr. Dre\\'s album 2001.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nOn December 15, 1981, when Dre was 16 years old and his then-girlfriend Cassandra Joy Greene was 15 years old, the two had a son named Curtis, who was brought up by Greene and first met Dre 20 years later. Curtis performed as a rapper under the name Hood Surgeon.\\nIn 1983, Dre and Lisa Johnson had a daughter named La Tanya Danielle Young. Dre and Johnson have three daughters together.\\nIn 1988, Dre and Jenita Porter had a son named Andre Young Jr. In 1990, Porter sued Dre, seeking $5,000 of child support per month. On August 23, 2008, Andre died at the age of 20 from an overdose of heroin and morphine at his mother\\'s Woodland Hills home.\\nFrom 1987 to 1996, Dre dated singer Michel\\'le, who frequently contributed vocals to Ruthless Records and Death Row Records albums. In 1991, they had a son named Marcel.\\nIn April 1992, after a verbal dispute with his engineer, Dre was consequently shot four times in his leg.\\nOn May 25, 1996, Dre married Nicole (née Plotzker) Threatt, who was previously married to basketball player Sedale Threatt. They have two children together: a son named Truice (born 1997) and a daughter named Truly (born 2001).\\nIn 2001, Dre earned a total of about US$52 million from selling part of his share of Aftermath Entertainment to Interscope Records and his production of such hit songs that year as \"Family Affair\" by Mary J. Blige. Rolling Stone magazine thus named him the second highest-paid artist of the year. Dr. Dre was ranked 44th in 2004 from earnings of $11.4 million, primarily from production royalties from such projects as albums from G-Unit and D12 and the single \"Rich Girl\" by singer Gwen Stefani and rapper Eve. Forbes estimated his net worth at US$270 million in 2012. The same publication later reported that he acquired US$110 million via his various endeavors in 2012, making him the highest–paid artist of the year. Income from the 2014 sale of Beats to Apple, contributing to what Forbes termed \"the biggest single-year payday of any musician in history\", made Dr. Dre the world\\'s richest musical performer of 2015. He remains one of the wealthiest musical artists.\\nIn 2014, Dre purchased a $40 million home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles from its previous owners, NFL player Tom Brady and supermodel Gisele Bündchen.\\nIt was reported that Dre suffered a brain aneurysm on January 5, 2021, and that he was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center\\'s ICU in Los Angeles, California. Hours after his admission to the hospital, Dre\\'s home was targeted for an attempted burglary. He eventually received support from LeBron James, Martin Lawrence, LL Cool J, Missy Elliott, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Ice Cube, 50 Cent, Ellen DeGeneres, Ciara, her husband Russell Wilson, T.I., Quincy Jones and others. In February, he was released with a following message on Instagram: \"Thanks to my family, friends and fans for their interest and well wishes. I\\'m doing great and getting excellent care from my medical team. I will be out of the hospital and back home soon. Shout out to all the great medical professionals at Cedars. One Love!!\" In March 2024, Dre revealed that during his hospitalization following the brain aneurysm, he also suffered three strokes.\\nIn December 2021, Dre finalized his divorce from Nicole Threatt for a reported sum of $100 million of his estate.\\nDre is a fan of both the Los Angeles Rams of the NFL, and the Los Angeles Lakers of the NBA.\\n\\nControversies and legal issues\\nViolence against women\\nDre has been accused of multiple incidents of violence against women.\\nOn January 27, 1991, at a music industry party at the Po Na Na Souk club in Hollywood, Dr. Dre assaulted television host Dee Barnes of the Fox television program Pump it Up!, following an episode of the show. Barnes had interviewed NWA, which was followed by an interview with Ice Cube in which Cube mocked NWA. Barnes filed a $22.7 million lawsuit in response to the incident. Subsequently, Dr. Dre was fined $2,500, given two years\\' probation, ordered to undergo 240 hours of community service, and given a spot on an anti-violence public service announcement on television. The civil suit was settled out of court. Barnes stated that he \"began slamming her face and the right side of her body repeatedly against a wall near the stairway\". Dr. Dre later commented: \"People talk all this shit, but you know, somebody fucks with me, I\\'m gonna fuck with them. I just did it, you know. Ain\\'t nothing you can do now by talking about it. Besides, it ain\\'t no big thing – I just threw her through a door.\"\\nIn March 2015, Michel\\'le, the mother of one of Dre\\'s children, accused him of subjecting her to domestic violence during their time together as a couple, but did not initiate legal action. Their abusive relationship is portrayed in her 2016 biopic Surviving Compton: Dre, Suge & Michel\\'le. Dre threatened a lawsuit against Lifetime, Sony Pictures and filmmakers of Surviving Compton in a cease and desist, but never ultimately took action.\\nInterviewed by Ben Westhoff for the book Original Gangstas: the Untold Story of Dr Dre, Eazy-E, Ice Cube, Tupac Shakur, and the Birth of West Coast Rap, Lisa Johnson stated that Dre beat her many times, including while she was pregnant. She was granted a restraining order against him.\\nFormer labelmate Tairrie B claimed that Dre assaulted her at a post-Grammy party in 1990, in response to her track \"Ruthless Bitch\".\\nDuring press for the 2015 film Straight Outta Compton, questions about the portrayal and behavior of Dre and other prominent figures in the rap community about violence against women – and the question about its absence in the film – were raised. The discussion about the film led to Dre addressing his past behavior in the press. In August 2015, in an interview with Rolling Stone, Dre lamented his abusive past, saying, \"I made some fucking horrible mistakes in my life. I was young, fucking stupid. I would say all the allegations aren\\'t true—some of them are. Those are some of the things that I would like to take back. It was really fucked up. But I paid for those mistakes, and there\\'s no way in hell that I will ever make another mistake like that again.\"\\nIn a statement to The New York Times on August 21, 2015, exactly two weeks after his album, Compton, was released, Dre again addressed his abusive past, stating, \"25 years ago I was a young man drinking too much and in over my head with no real structure in my life. However, none of this is an excuse for what I did. I\\'ve been married for 19 years and every day I\\'m working to be a better man for my family, seeking guidance along the way. I\\'m doing everything I can so I never resemble that man again. ... I apologize to the women I\\'ve hurt. I deeply regret what I did and know that it has forever impacted all of our lives.\"\\nIn the 2017 film The Defiant Ones, Dr. Dre explained about the Dee Barnes incident again, \"This was a very low point in my life. I\\'ve done a lot of stupid shit in my life. A lot of things I wish I could go and take back. I\\'ve experienced abuse. I\\'ve watched my mother get abused. So there\\'s absolutely no excuse for it. No woman should ever be treated that way. Any man that puts his hands on a female is a fucking idiot. He\\'s out of his fucking mind, and I was out of my fucking mind at the time. I fucked up, I paid for it, I\\'m sorry for it, and I apologize for it. I have this dark cloud that follows me, and it\\'s going to be attached to me forever. It\\'s a major blemish on who I am as a man.\"\\n\\nSecond divorce\\nDre\\'s wife, Nicole Plotzker-Young, filed for divorce in June 2020, citing irreconcilable differences. In November 2020, she filed legal claims that Dre engaged in verbal violence and infidelity during their marriage. She also stated that he tore up their prenuptial agreement that he wanted her to sign out of anger. Dre\\'s representative responded, calling her claims of infidelity and violence in their marriage \"false\". \\nBefore being released from the Cedar-Sinai Medical Center, he was ordered to pay Plotzker-Young $2 million in temporary spousal support. Between the spring and summer of the year, Dre was ordered by the Los Angeles County judge to pay his ex-wife over $300,000 a month in spousal support. The $2 million extension request was also dismissed, due to insufficient claims. \\nIn July 2021, Dr. Dre was ordered by the Los Angeles Superior Court Judge to pay an additional $293,306 a month to his estranged wife in spousal support starting August 1 until she decides to remarry or \"further order of the Court\". Then, in August, the judge denied his wife\\'s request for a protective order, due to her being afraid of Dre after a snippet leaked on Instagram of him rapping about the divorce proceedings and his possible brain aneurysm earlier that February; in this snippet, he called his wife a \"greedy bitch\". \\nIn mid-October, Dr. Dre was served more divorce papers, during his grandmother\\'s funeral. That same month, Dre was officially deemed \"single\" by the judge. The financial owings in this case included expenses of Dre\\'s Malibu, Palisades and Hollywood Hills homes, but not his stock in past ownership of Beats Electronics, prior to its sale to Apple in 2014. In December 2021, the divorce proceedings entered their final stages. On December 28, the divorce was settled with Dre keeping most of his assets and income due to the prenuptial agreement, although he would have to pay a 9-figure settlement within one year.\\n\\nCopyright lawsuits\\nDuring the course of 2001\\'s popularity, Dr. Dre was involved in several lawsuits. Lucasfilm Ltd., the film company behind the Star Wars film franchise, sued him over the use of the THX-trademarked \"Deep Note\". The Fatback Band also sued Dr. Dre over alleged infringement regarding its song \"Backstrokin\\'\" in his song \"Let\\'s Get High\" from the 2001 album; Dr. Dre was ordered to pay $1.5 million to the band in 2003. French jazz musician Jacques Loussier sued Aftermath for $10 million in March 2002, claiming that the Dr. Dre-produced Eminem track \"Kill You\" plagiarized his composition \"Pulsion\". The online music file-sharing company Napster also settled a lawsuit with him and metal band Metallica in mid-2001, agreeing to block access to certain files that artists do not want to have shared on the network.\\nAnother copyright-related lawsuit hit Dr. Dre in the fall of 2002, when Sa Re Ga Ma, a film and music company based in Calcutta, India, sued Aftermath Entertainment over an uncredited sample of the Lata Mangeshkar song \"Thoda Resham Lagta Hai\" on the Aftermath-produced song \"Addictive\" by singer Truth Hurts. In February 2003, a judge ruled that Aftermath would have to halt sales of Truth Hurts\\' album Truthfully Speaking if the company would not credit Mangeshkar.\\n\\nOther\\nOn June 28, 1992, hours before midnight, a barbecue grill and an overfill of charcoal caused Dre\\'s Calabasas mansion to set on fire. Two firefighters who exhausted the fire were treated in the hospital for minor injuries. The fire caused over $125,000 in home damages.\\nDre pleaded guilty in October 1992 in a case of battery of a police officer and was convicted on two additional battery counts stemming from a brawl in the lobby of the New Orleans hotel in May 1991.\\nIn 1993, he was convicted of battery after an altercation with a man who stood outside the front porch of his Woodland Hills home in front of the musician\\'s girlfriend. He claimed that Dre broke his jaw as a result.\\nOn January 10, 1994, Dre was arrested after leading police on a 90 mph pursuit through Beverly Hills in his 1987 Ferrari. It was revealed that Dr. Dre had a blood alcohol of 0.16, twice the state of California\\'s legal limit. The conviction violated the conditions of parole following Dre\\'s battery conviction in 1993; he pleaded no contest and was sentenced to eight months in prison in September 1994. He was ordered to pay a $1,053 fine and attend an alcohol education program.\\nIn November 2004, at the Vibe magazine awards show in Los Angeles, Dr. Dre was attacked by a fan named Jimmy James Johnson, who was supposedly asking for an autograph. In the resulting scuffle, then-G-Unit rapper Young Buck stabbed the man. Johnson claimed that Suge Knight, president of Death Row Records, paid him $5,000 to assault Dre in order to humiliate him before he received his Lifetime Achievement Award. Knight immediately went on CBS\\'s The Late Late Show to deny involvement and insisted that he supported Dr. Dre and wanted Johnson charged. In September 2005, Johnson was sentenced to a year in prison and ordered to stay away from Dr. Dre until 2008.\\nOn October 30, 2015, Ruthless co-founder Jerry Heller filed suit against Dre, Ice Cube, Eazy-E\\'s widow, Tomica Woods-Wright, director F. Gary Gray and Universal Pictures for defamation of character and copyright infringement over the biopic, Straight Outta Compton. The lawsuit states that depictions of Heller in the film, portrayed by Paul Giamatti, were wrongfully taken from an autobiography he wrote about his involvement with Ruthless and N.W.A. The case was taken to court in June 2016 where a judge criticized the filing, saying that the film was \"approved to portray these facts in \"colorful and hyperbolic\" terms\". On September 2, 2016, Jerry Heller died of a car accident, preceded by a heart attack. However, his lawsuit kept on through his legal team and members of his estate. In October 2018, the lawsuit was dropped, costing Heller\\'s estate $35 million for punitive and $75 million for compensatory damages.\\nOn April 4, 2016, TMZ and the New York Daily News reported that Suge Knight had accused Dre and the Los Angeles Sheriff\\'s Department of a kill-for-hire plot in the 2014 shooting of Knight in club 1 OAK. Three months later, in July, Dre was reportedly detained by police after confronting a next-door neighbor in Malibu about a test drive. It was also alleged that he brandished a handgun on the neighbor, but no evidence would be linked and Dre was soon released.\\nOn May 8, 2018, Dre lost a name trademark filing to a Pennsylvania gynecologist named Draion Burch, who previously filed a trademark petition in 2015 to use his nickname, Dr. Drai, which has the similar pronunciation. Then, on June 26, Dre and Jimmy Iovine were ordered to pay $25 million to former partner and creative designer Steven Lamar, who sued the two co-founders for $100 million in unpaid royalties for designing the early Beats headphone models. The lawsuit was filed in 2015 after news broke out of Apple\\'s acquisition of the headphone brand a year prior.\\nIn August 2021, Dr. Dre\\'s oldest daughter LaTanya Young spoke out about being homeless and unable to support her four children. She is currently working for UberEats and DoorDash, and she also works at warehouse jobs. She is living in debt in her SUV while her children are living with friends. Dr. Dre has allegedly stopped supporting LaTanya financially since January 2020 because she has \"spoken about him in the press\".\\n\\nDiscography\\nStudio albums\\nThe Chronic (1992)\\n2001 (1999)\\nCompton (2015)\\n\\nCollaboration albums\\nwith World Class Wreckin\\' Cru\\n\\nWorld Class (1985)\\nRapped in Romance (1986)\\nwith N.W.A.\\n\\nStraight Outta Compton (1988)\\nNiggaz4Life (1991)\\n\\nAwards and nominations\\nIn March 2024, Dr. Dre received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6840 Hollywood Boulevard.\\n\\nAmerican Music Awards\\nBET Hip Hop Awards\\nGrammy Awards\\nDr. Dre has won eight Grammy Awards.

              " 'Shawn Corey Carter (born December 4, 1969), known professionally as Jay-Z, is an American rapper and entrepreneur. Born and raised in New York City, he was named the greatest rapper of all time by Billboard and Vibe in 2023. He served as the president and chief executive officer of Def Jam Recordings from 2004 to 2007 before founding the entertainment company, Roc Nation the following year.\\nAs a protégé of fellow New York City-based rapper Jaz-O, Jay-Z began his musical career in the late 1980s; he co-founded the record label Roc-A-Fella Records in 1994 to release his first two studio albums Reasonable Doubt (1996) and In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997), both of which were met with critical acclaim. His following albums, including The Blueprint (2001), The Black Album (2003), American Gangster (2007), and 4:44 (2017) each debuted atop the Billboard 200; Jay-Z holds the record for the most number-one albums (14) of any solo artist on the chart. He has also released the collaborative albums The Best of Both Worlds (2002) and Unfinished Business (2004) with singer R. Kelly, Collision Course (2004) with Linkin Park, Watch the Throne (2011) with Kanye West, and Everything Is Love (2018) with his wife Beyoncé. He peaked the Billboard Hot 100 on four occasions with his guest performances on the singles \"Heartbreaker\" by Mariah Carey, \"Crazy in Love\" by Beyoncé, \"Umbrella\" by Rihanna, and his first to do so as a lead artist, \"Empire State of Mind\" (with Alicia Keys).\\nThrough his business ventures, Jay-Z became the first hip-hop billionaire in 2019. In 1999, he co-founded the clothing retailer Rocawear and later founded the 40/40 Club, a luxury bar chain, in 2003. As both grew into multi-million-dollar businesses, he launched Roc Nation, a multi-disciplinary entertainment agency in 2008. In 2015, he acquired the technology company Aspiro and led the expansion of Tidal, the company\\'s media streaming service. As of 2024, he is the wealthiest musical artist in the world with a net worth of US$2.5 billion.\\nOne of the world\\'s best-selling music artists with 140 million records sold, Jay-Z has won 24 Grammy Awards, the tenth-most of all time and most awarded for any hip hop artist jointly with Kanye West. He has been awarded the NAACP\\'s President\\'s Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, a Sports Emmy Award, and been nominated for a Tony Award. Ranked by Billboard and Rolling Stone as one of the 100 greatest artists of all time, Jay-Z was the first rapper to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the first solo living rapper inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2013.\\n\\nEarly life and education\\nShawn Corey Carter was born on December 4, 1969, in Brooklyn, New York City. He was raised in Marcy Houses, a public housing project in Brooklyn\\'s Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood. His father, Adnis Reeves, abandoned the family, and Jay-Z and his three older siblings were raised by his mother, Gloria Carter. Reeves later met and reconciled with Jay-Z prior to his death in 2003. Jay-Z claims in his lyrics that in 1982, at age 12, he shot his older brother in the shoulder for stealing his jewelry.\\nHe attended Eli Whitney High School and George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School, both in Brooklyn, and then Trenton Central High School in Trenton, New Jersey. He did not graduate, dropping out during his sophomore year at Trenton Central High School. According to his interviews and lyrics, he sold crack cocaine and was shot at three times during this period. His former friend was sentenced to prison for possessing drugs and weapons. Known as \"Jazzy\" around the neighborhood, he later adopted the stage name \"Jay-Z\" in homage to his mentor Jaz-O.\\n\\nCareer\\nJay-Z can be briefly heard on several of Jaz-O\\'s early recordings in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including \"H. P. Gets Busy\", \"The Originators\" and \"Hawaiian Sophie\". Jay-Z became embroiled in several battles with rapper LL Cool J in the early 1990s. He first became known to a wide audience on the posse cut \"Show and Prove\" on the 1994 Big Daddy Kane album Daddy\\'s Home. Jay-Z has been referred to as Big Daddy Kane\\'s hype man during this period, although Kane explains that he did not fill the traditional hype man role, and was instead basically making cameo appearances on stage. \"When I would leave the stage to go change outfits, I would bring out Jay-Z and Positive K and let them freestyle until I came back to the stage.\"\\nAccording to his second verse on \"99 Problems\", released in 2003, Jay-Z was allegedly stopped by an NYPD detective in 1994 while en route to I-95, possibly for a search of drugs in his car. Detection dogs were called, but another police car had passed; Jay-Z was let go soon after. Jay-Z appeared on a popular song by Big L, \"Da Graveyard\", and on Mic Geronimo\\'s \"Time to Build\", which also featured early appearances by his former Murder Inc. colleagues Ja Rule and DMX in 1995. His first official rap single was \"In My Lifetime\", which was released with an accompanying music video in 1995. An unreleased music video was also produced for the B-side \"I Can\\'t Get with That.\"\\n\\n1995–2000: Reasonable Doubt, In My Lifetime, Vol. 1, Vol. 2..., Vol. 3..., and The Dynasty\\nWith no major label to give him a record deal, Jay-Z sold burned CDs out of his car, and with Damon \"Dame\" Dash and Kareem \"Biggs\" Burke, created Roc-A-Fella Records as an independent label in 1995. After striking a distribution deal with Priority, Jay-Z released his 1996 debut album Reasonable Doubt with beats from acclaimed producers such as DJ Premier and Super DJ Clark Kent and an appearance by The Notorious B.I.G. The album reached number 23 on the Billboard 200, and was generally favored by critics. This album would later be included in Rolling Stone\\'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time as No. 248 and eventually reach platinum status. After reaching a new label distribution deal with Def Jam in 1997, Jay-Z released his follow-up In My Lifetime, Vol. 1. Featuring production by Sean \"Puff Daddy\" Combs, DJ Premier, and Ski, it earned platinum status in the United States.\\nIn 1998, Jay-Z released Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life which spawned the biggest hit of his career at the time, \"Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\". He relied more on flow and wordplay, and he continued with his penchant for mining beats from the popular producers of the day such as Swizz Beatz, an upstart in-house producer for Ruff Ryders, and Timbaland. Other producers included DJ Premier, Erick Sermon, The 45 King, and Kid Capri. Charting hits from this album included \"Can I Get A...\", featuring Ja Rule and Amil, and \"Nigga What, Nigga Who\", featuring Amil and Jaz-O. Vol. 2 would eventually become Jay-Z\\'s most commercially successful album; it was certified 5× Platinum in the United States and has to date sold over five million copies. The album went on to win a Grammy Award, although Jay-Z boycotted the ceremony protesting DMX\\'s failure to garner a Grammy nomination and the academy\\'s decision to not broadcast urban music categories. \\nIn 1999, Jay-Z collaborated with Mariah Carey on \"Heartbreaker\", a song from her seventh album, Rainbow. The song became Jay-Z\\'s first chart-topper in the US, spending two weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100. In that same year, Jay-Z released Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter. The album proved successful and sold over 3 million copies. Vol. 3\\'s most successful single was \"Big Pimpin\", featuring UGK.\\nIn 2000, Jay-Z released The Dynasty: Roc La Familia, which was originally intended to become a compilation album for Roc-A-Fella artists but Def Jam turned into a Jay-Z album. The album helped to introduce newcomer producers The Neptunes, Just Blaze, Kanye West, and Bink, which have all gone on to achieve notable success. This is also the first album where Jay-Z utilizes a more soulful sound than his previous albums. The Dynasty sold over two million units in the U.S. alone.\\n\\n2001–2002: Feud with Nas, The Blueprint and The Blueprint2\\nIn 2001, Jay-Z spoke out against Prodigy after he took an issue with a Jay-Z line from \"Money, Cash, Hoes\" that he felt alluded disparagingly to Mobb Deep and Prodigy\\'s dispute with Tupac Shakur, Snoop Dogg, and Death Row Records. He later performed the song \"Takeover\", at Summer Jam 2001, which initially attacked Prodigy and revealed photos of Prodigy dressed like Michael Jackson. A line at the end of \"Takeover\" referred to Nas, who criticized him on \"We Will Survive\". Nas responded with a diss track called \"Ether\" and Jay-Z straightaway added a verse to \"Takeover\" which dissed Nas and would start a feud between the two rappers. The feud had ended by 2005; Jay-Z stated that record producer Mark Pitts had helped them settle their differences.\\nOn September 11, 2001, Jay-Z released his sixth studio album, The Blueprint, which received a five-mic review from hip-hop magazine The Source. Written in just two days, the album sold more than 427,000 copies, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached double platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. Eminem guest performed and produced its song, \"Renegade\". Four tracks were produced by Kanye West. The Blueprint includes the songs \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.)\", \"Girls, Girls, Girls\", \"Jigga That Nigga\", and \"Song Cry\". As of February 2012, the album had sold 2.7 million copies worldwide. In 2019, The Blueprint was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\\nIn October 2001, Jay-Z pleaded guilty to aggravated assault for stabbing record producer Lance Rivera at the Kit Kat Klub in New York City in 1999. Despite Jay-Z\\'s sentence of three years probation for the crime, Rivera later recanted the allegations in 2023.\\nJay-Z then collaborated with Chicago singer R. Kelly to release collaborative studio album, The Best of Both Worlds in March 2002. In November of that year, Jay-Z released his seventh studio album The Blueprint2: The Gift & The Curse—a double album. The album debuted on the Billboard 200 at number one, selling over 3 million units solely in the U.S. and surpassing The Blueprint. It yielded a single-disc re-issue, The Blueprint 2.1, which retained half of the songs from the original. Its original release spawned two hit singles, \"Excuse Me Miss\" and \"\\'03 Bonnie & Clyde\", which features Jay-Z\\'s then-girlfriend, Beyoncé, and contained the track \"A Dream\", featuring Faith Evans and the late Notorious B.I.G.; the re-issue spawned the single \"La-La-La\", which was a sequel to \"Excuse Me Miss\" and failed to match its commercial success.\\n\\n2003–2005: The Black Album and initial retirement\\nAfter visiting the south of France, Jay-Z announced work on his eighth studio album, The Black Album at the opening of the 40/40 Club. He worked with several producers including Just Blaze, The Neptunes, Kanye West, Timbaland, Eminem, DJ Quik, 9th Wonder, The Buchanans, and Rick Rubin. Notable songs on the album included \"What More Can I Say\", \"Dirt off Your Shoulder\", \"Change Clothes\", and \"99 Problems\". The Black Album has sold over 3 million copies in the U.S.\\nOn November 25, 2003, Jay-Z held a concert—billed as a \"retirement party\" at Madison Square Garden in New York City, which was later the focus of his 2004 documentary, Fade to Black. All proceeds went to charity. Other performers included collaborators the Roots (in the form of his backing band), Missy Elliott, Memphis Bleek, Beanie Siegel, Freeway, Mary J. Blige, Beyoncé, Twista, Ghostface Killah, Foxy Brown, Pharrell Williams and R. Kelly, with appearances by Voletta Wallace and Afeni Shakur, the mothers of the Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur, respectively. While Jay-Z had attested to a retirement from making new studio albums, various side projects and appearances soon followed. Included in these were a greatest hits record, as well as the release and tour of Unfinished Business, the second collaborative album between Jay-Z and R. Kelly.\\nIn 2004, Jay-Z collaborated with rock group Linkin Park, in which they released their collaborative remix EP Collision Course, which featured mashups of both artists\\' songs, as well as a concert DVD. The album\\'s only single, \"Numb/Encore\", went on to win a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration, and was performed with Linkin Park live at the Grammys, with a special appearance by Paul McCartney, who added verses from the song \"Yesterday\". The EP sold over 1 million copies in the U.S. Jay-Z was the executive producer of The Rising Tied, the debut album of Fort Minor, the hip hop side project of Linkin Park rapper Mike Shinoda. Jay-Z also planned to retire in 2004.\\nLater in 2004, Jay-Z was named president of Def Jam Records, which led to Jay-Z, Dash and Biggs selling their remaining interests in Roc-A-Fella Records and Jay-Z taking control of both of the companies. Reportedly this major industry move was prompted by disagreements between Jay-Z and Dash as to what direction Roc-A-Fella could undertake.\\n\\n2005–2007: Kingdom Come and American Gangster\\nOn October 27, 2005, Jay-Z headlined New York\\'s Power 105.1 annual concert, Powerhouse. The concert was entitled the \"I Declare War\" concert leading to intense speculation in the weeks preceding the event on whom exactly Jay-Z would declare war. As he had previously \"declared war\" on other artists taking lyrical shots at him at other events, many believed that the Powerhouse show would represent an all-out assault by Jay-Z upon his rivals. The theme of the concert was Jay-Z\\'s position as president and CEO of Def Jam, complete with an on-stage mock-up of the Oval Office. Many artists made appearances such as the old roster of Roc-A-Fella records artists, as well as Ne-Yo, Teairra Marí, T.I., Young Jeezy, Akon, Kanye West, Paul Wall, The LOX, and Diddy.\\nAt the conclusion of the concert, Jay-Z put many arguments to rest to the surprise of hip hop fans. The most significant development in this show was closure to the infamous hip hop rivalry between Jay-Z and Nas. The two former rivals shook hands and shared the stage together to perform Jay-Z\\'s \"Dead Presidents\" blended with Nas\\'s song \"The World is Yours\".\\nJay-Z returned with his comeback album on November 21, 2006, titled Kingdom Come. Jay-Z\\'s comeback single, \"Show Me What You Got\", was leaked on the Internet in early October 2006, scheduled to be released later on that month, received heavy air-play after its leak, causing the FBI to step in and investigate. Jay-Z worked with video director Hype Williams, and the single\\'s video was directed by F. Gary Gray. The album features production from Just Blaze, Pharrell, Kanye West, Dr. Dre and Coldplay\\'s Chris Martin (single entitled \"Beach Chair\"). The first week saw 680,000 sales of the CD, enough to be his \"biggest sales week ever\" as Billboard reported. This album has sold 2 million copies in the U.S.\\nJay-Z released his tenth album entitled American Gangster on November 6, 2007. After viewing the Ridley Scott film of the same name, Jay-Z was heavily inspired to create a new \"concept\" album that depicts his experiences as a street-hustler.\\nThe album is not the film\\'s official soundtrack, although it was distributed by Def Jam.\\nJay-Z\\'s American Gangster depicts his life in correlation to the movie American Gangster. At the start of the album\\'s first single, \"Blue Magic\", Jay-Z offers a dealer\\'s manifesto while making references to political figures of the late 1980s with the lyric: \"Blame Reagan for making me to into a monster, blame Oliver North and Iran-Contra, I ran contraband that they sponsored, before this rhymin\\' stuff we was in concert.\" Also notable about the \"Blue Magic\" music video was Jay-Z flashing €500 notes; Harvard Business School professor Rawi Abdelal called this a \"turning point in American pop culture\\'s response to globalization.\" The album has sold 1 million copies in the U.S. On January 1, 2008, Jay-Z resigned as president of Def Jam.\\n\\n2008–2011: The Blueprint 3 and Watch the Throne\\nIn winter 2008, it was announced that Jay-Z would become the first major hip hop artist to headline Britain\\'s Glastonbury Festival. Tickets sold out quickly. Former headliner Noel Gallagher of Oasis condemned the festival organizers for choosing Jay-Z to headline a traditionally guitar-driven festival. \"I\\'m sorry, but Jay-Z?\" Gallagher asked, swearing. \"No chance. Glastonbury has a tradition of, kind of, guitar music, do you know what I mean? And even when they throw the odd curve balls in on a Sunday night—you go, \\'Kylie Minogue? I don\\'t know about that\\', do you know what I mean?—but I\\'m not having hip hop at Glastonbury, no way, no, no. It\\'s wrong.\" As controversy mounted, Jay-Z replied, \"We don\\'t play guitars, Noel, but hip hop has put in its work like any other form of music. This headline show is just a natural progression. Rap music is still evolving. We have to respect each other\\'s genre of music and move forward.\" Jay-Z opened his Glastonbury set with a tongue-in-cheek cover of Oasis\\'s iconic song \"Wonderwall\", and went on to deliver a performance heralded as a successful response to pre-festival criticism.\\nHe also headlined many other summer festivals in 2008, including Roskilde Festival in Denmark, Hove Festival in Norway and O2 Wireless Festival in London. During Kanye West\\'s concert of August 6, 2008, at Madison Square Garden, Jay-Z came out to perform a new song and he and West proclaimed that it was to be on The Blueprint 3. On May 21, 2009, Jay-Z announced he would be parting ways with Def Jam, and had struck a multi-million-dollar deal to sign with Live Nation, with whom he would start his Roc Nation imprint which would serve as a record label, talent/management agency, and music publishing company and also partnered with production team Stargate to start a record label called StarRoc. Jay-Z\\'s 11th studio album The Blueprint 3 was originally to be released on September 11, 2009, but was instead released in North America on September 8, 2009, due to increasing anticipation. Its international release followed on September 14. It is his 11th album to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and has surpassed Elvis Presley\\'s previous record, making him the current solo-artist record holder. On October 9, 2009, Jay-Z kicked off his tour for The Blueprint 3, during which he supported his new album in North America. In a Shave Magazine review of his performance at Rexall Place in Edmonton, Jake Tomlinson expressed that \"It was the type of smooth performance you would expect from the hip-hop superstar.\" The review gave this performance 4 stars. His North American tour continued until November 22, 2009. At his concert on November 8, 2009, at UCLA\\'s Pauley Pavilion, Rihanna joined him on stage and performed \"Hard\" for the first time, then performed \"Run This Town\" with Jay-Z. Among his success, Jay-Z has ventured into producing Broadway shows. Along with Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith, Jay-Z helped produce the play Fela!, a musical celebrating the work of the late Nigerian star Fela Kuti. Jay-Z said he was inspired by the power of Kuti\\'s work and his life story, which resulted in his interest to help produce the musical. Fela! is a story about an African pioneer and political activist who made his first moves on the scene during the 1970s.\\n\\nOn January 23, 2010, Jay-Z released a track, \"Stranded (Haiti Mon Amour)\", with Rihanna, and U2\\'s Bono and The Edge, as well as performing it at the Hope For Haiti Now telethon. In June 2010, Eminem and Jay-Z announced they would perform together in a pair of concerts in Detroit and New York. The event was dubbed The Home & Home Tour. The first two concerts rapidly sold out, prompting the scheduling of an additional show at each venue. Jay-Z was the supporting act for U2 on the Australian and New Zealand leg of their U2 360° Tour, beginning in Auckland, New Zealand, in November 2010, followed by Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth in December.\\nJay-Z also appeared on stage during U2 performances of \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", and in Auckland also on a five-track EP entitled Watch the Throne, although it was later revealed by West that the project had become a full-length LP. Recording sessions for the album took place at various recording locations and began in November 2010. The first single released for the project was \"H•A•M\". The track was co-produced by Lex Luger and West himself. The track ended up being on the deluxe edition of the album. The follow-up to that was the second single \"Otis\", which premiered on Funkmaster Flex\\'s Hot 97 radio show, and was later released to the iTunes Store eleven days later. The song\\'s existence, along with several other tracks from the album, was confirmed during a listening session hosted by Jay-Z. The album was first released on the iTunes Store, five days prior to its being released in physical format, a strategy Jay-Z later said was used to block an internet leak. It debuted at No. 1 on the iTunes Store in 23 countries. It also broke Coldplay\\'s record for most albums sold in one week on the online retailer, selling 290,000 copies on iTunes alone. It held that record until Lil Wayne\\'s Tha Carter IV was released twenty-one days later, selling 10,000 copies more. It debuted on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart at No. 1, selling 436,000 copies in its first week. The album received generally positive reviews.

He says \"I grew up around music, listening to all types of people... I\\'m into music that has soul in it, whether it be rap, R&B, pop music, whatever. As long as I can feel their soul through the wax, that\\'s what I really listen to.\" He often uses excerpts from these artists as samples in his work, particularly in the Kanye West productions included on The Blueprint.\\n\\nRapping technique\\nRoyce da 5\\'9\" and Fredro Starr of Onyx both describe Jay-Z\\'s emphasis on flow in the book How to Rap—Starr says that Jay-Z is \"a master of the flow—he can flow fast, he can flow slow\".

It\\'s not like running GM, where there\\'s no emotional attachment.\"\\n\\nRocawear\\nJay-Z and Damon Dash are the founders of the urban clothing brand Rocawear.

He retains his stake in the company and continues to oversee the marketing, licensing and product development.\\n\\nReebok\\nJay-Z became the first rapper in Reebok\\'s history to endorse the company\\'s footwear, signing a three-year endorsement deal. He later appeared in a 2003 Reebok collection advertising his S. Carter Collection. Later that year, he and frenemy 50 Cent appeared in a commercial to promote their S.

The music service was acquired through his company Project Panther Bidco Ltd. (an entity indirectly owned by Jay-Z\\'s S. Carter Enterprises a company holding interests in leading international music, media and entertainment companies). The music service combines audio and music videos with curated editorial. The main idea of the service is to bring major revenue streams back to the music artists themselves as the idea of an artist-owned streaming platform was stated as to \"restore the value to music by launching a service owned by artists.\" Jay-Z currently is a major shareholder in the company.\\nIn July 2015, Carter made a significant investment to JetSmarter, an app helping people book private executive plane flights.

Since their marriage, they generally avoid discussing their relationship, and Beyoncé has stated her belief that this has helped them, while Jay-Z agreed in a People article that they do not \"play with [their] relationship\".\\nIn 2006, Beyoncé and Jay-Z were listed as the most powerful couple for Time magazine\\'s 100 most influential people. In January 2009, Forbes ranked them as Hollywood\\'s top-earning couple, with a combined total of $162 million.

Jay-Z\\'s associates at the party were accused of causing a commotion within the club, which Jay-Z allegedly used as cover while he stabbed Rivera in the stomach with a five-inch (127 mm) blade. He surrendered to police the following evening and was placed under arrest, although he was soon released on $50,000 bail. When he was indicted in Manhattan Criminal Court in late January 2000, he pleaded not guilty; he and his lawyers contended that they had witnesses and videotapes proving he had been nowhere near Rivera during the incident. Nevertheless, he later pleaded guilty to third-degree assault and accepted a three-year probation sentence.\\nJay-Z later addressed the case in his 2010 book Decoded:\\n\\nOne night I went to Q-Tip\\'s solo album release party and at some point in the night, I ran into the guy everyone\\'s been telling me is behind the bootleg. So I approached him. When I told him what I suspected, to my surprise, he got real loud with me right there in the middle of the club. It was strange. We separated and I went over to the bar. I was sitting there like, \"No the fuck this nigga did not...\" I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. The next thing I knew, all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted. [...] There was no reason to put my life on the line, and the lives of everyone who depends on me, because of a momentary loss of control. [...] I vowed to never allow myself to be in a situation like that again.\\nIn 2023, Rivera stated that Jay-Z lied, and was not the one that stabbed him: “No. Jay-Z was not the guy that actually stabbed me that night (...) it’s never been his history”.\\n\\nPhilanthropy\\nDuring his first retirement from music, Jay-Z became involved in philanthropy.

In 2008, Jay-Z was  involved in the 2008 United States presidential election, supporting enhanced voter participation. He supported the 2008 presidential candidacy of Barack Obama and performed voter-drive concerts financed by the Democrats\\' campaign. He also became acquainted with Obama, who in June 2008 said, \"Every time I talk to Jay-Z, who is a brilliant talent and a good guy, I enjoy how he thinks.

Thus, he is the biggest-selling singer in the history of classical music.\\nIn 1999, his nomination for Best New Artist at the Grammy Awards marked the first time a classical artist had been nominated in the category, since Leontyne Price, in 1961. The Prayer, his duet with Celine Dion for the animated film, The Quest for Camelot, won the Golden Globe for Best Original Song and was nominated for an Academy Award in the same category. With the release of his classical album, Sacred Arias, Bocelli captured a listing in the Guinness Book of World Records, as he simultaneously held the No. 1, 2 and 3 positions on the US Classical albums chart. The next three-and-a-half years followed with Bocelli holding permanent residency at the No. 1 spot. Six of his albums have since reached the Top 10 on the Billboard 200, and a record-setting 7, have topped the Classical albums charts, in the United States.\\nWith 5 million units sold worldwide, Sacred Arias became the biggest-selling classical album by a solo artist of all time, and with just under 20 million units sold worldwide, his 1997 pop album, Romanza, became the best-selling album by an Italian artist ever, as well as the best-selling album by a foreign artist in Canada, and a number of other countries in Europe and Latin America.

              " 'Lecrae Devaughn Moore (born October 9, 1979) is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, record executive, and actor.\\nHe is the president, co-owner and co-founder of the independent record label Reach Records, was the co-founder and president of the now-defunct non-profit organization ReachLife Ministries, is an investor and co-owner of the audio production software MXD, and is a co-founder of the film production studio 3 Strand Films. To date, he has released ten studio albums and three mixtapes as a solo artist, and has released three studio albums, a remix album, one EP, and numerous singles as the leader of the hip hop group 116 Clique. He produced much of his earlier material along with other early Reach Records releases. Lecrae, in reference to him being labeled as a Christian rapper, has stated that his music is just hip hop, though it reflects his Christian faith. In May 2016, Lecrae signed to Columbia Records in a joint deal between his label and Columbia. He left Columbia in May 2020.\\nLecrae\\'s debut recording, Real Talk, was released in 2004 through Reach Records. His third solo album, Rebel, released in 2008, became the first Christian hip-hop album to reach No. 1 on the Billboard Gospel chart. Rehab followed in 2010, and Lecrae began attracting mainstream attention when he performed at the 2011 BET Hip Hop Awards Cypher and appeared on the Statik Selektah song \"Live & Let Live\" from Population Control. On May 10, 2012, Lecrae released his first mixtape, Church Clothes, which was hosted by Don Cannon. Considered his breakthrough into mainstream hip hop, the mixtape was downloaded over 100,000 times in less than 48 hours. His sixth studio album, Gravity, came out on September 4, 2012, and has been called the most important album in Christian hip hop history by Rapzilla and Atlanta Daily World. The album debuted as the best-selling album overall in the iTunes Store, No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and won the Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards, marking the first time that a hip hop artist received this award. Lecrae released his seventh album, Anomaly, on September 9, 2014. It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with 88,587 copies sold through the first week, the first album to top both the Billboard 200 and the Gospel chart simultaneously. He released a third mixtape, Church Clothes 3, on January 15, 2016, an eighth studio album, All Things Work Together, on September 22, 2017, and a ninth studio album, Let the Trap Say Amen, a collaborative project with Zaytoven, on June 22, 2018. His tenth studio album, Restoration, was released on August 21, 2020.\\nLecrae received nominations for Artist of the Year at the 43rd, 44th, 45th, and 46th GMA Dove Awards, the last of which he won, and for Best Gospel Artist at the 2013 and 2015 BET Awards, the latter of which he won, a first for a rap artist. Lecrae\\'s filmography includes a role in the television film A Cross to Bear (2012) and brief roles in the comedy film Believe Me (2014), crime film Superfly (2018), and Christian drama film Breakthrough (2019). In the social sphere, Lecrae has presented on and written about racial tension and injustice in the United States as well as advocated for the preservation of responsibility and fatherhood values among men in the United States. In 2013 he partnered with Dwyane Wade and Joshua DuBois in the multimedia initiative This Is Fatherhood as part of the Obama administration\\'s Fatherhood and Mentoring Initiative, and in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic worked with Love Beyond Walls to distribute hand-washing stations and food to homeless people in Atlanta.\\n\\nLife and career\\nEarly life\\nLecrae was raised by his single mother in a poor neighborhood in southern Houston. Shortly after his birth, he moved to Denver, away from his father, then to San Diego. At the age of 6, he was sexually abused by his babysitter. As a teenager, his role models were the rapper Tupac Shakur and his uncle, a member of a street gang.\\nAt age 16, he began using drugs, trying almost every substance except crack and heroin. He started stealing in high school and dealing drugs, using his grandmother\\'s Bible as a lucky charm. He was arrested for possession of drugs, but the policeman who arrested him discovered his Bible and made him promise that, if he let Lecrae go, he would live according to biblical principles from now on. Subsequently, he began rehab. He dropped drugs but replaced them with alcohol and partying.\\nLecrae received a scholarship to study theater at the University of North Texas, and graduated with a Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sciences in 2002. He also briefly attended Middle Tennessee State University.\\nAt 19, he went to a Bible study after being invited by a girl from college. He was amazed to see people like himself there, who liked the same books and music, but who were loving. He decided to live for God, but continued to make bad choices. Following a friend\\'s invitation, he attended a Christian conference in Atlanta and was impressed by the performance of a Christian rap group, The Cross Movement. He was also touched by a clear presentation of the gospel by Pastor James White (of Christ Our King Community Church). He then asked forgiveness for his sins and claimed to have experienced a new birth.\\nSubsequently, he was in a car accident but came out unscathed. In 2003, in a Bible study meeting at Denton Bible Church in Denton, Texas, he met Ben Washer, with whom he would volunteer and sing in a juvenile correctional facility. Young people\\'s positive response to Christian rap encouraged them to start a label.\\n\\nEarly career (2004–2011)\\nIn 2004, five years after his conversion, Lecrae teamed up with Ben Washer to found Reach Records, and at the age of 25 he released his first album, Real Talk. The following year it was re-released by Cross Movement Records and reached No. 29 on the Billboard Gospel Albums chart, staying on the chart for 12 weeks. The album later received a nomination at the 2007 Stellar Awards. In 2005, Lecrae co-founded the non-profit organization ReachLife Ministries (no longer operational since April 2015), which equipped local Christian leaders with tools, media, curriculum, and conferences that were based on the teachings of the Bible and relevant to hip-hop culture. Also in 2005, the debut album of 116 Clique, The Compilation Album, was released.\\nAfter the success of Real Talk, Lecrae then released his second studio album on August 15, 2006. After the Music Stops charted at No. 5 on the Billboard Gospel Albums chart, No. 7 on the Billboard Christian Albums chart and No. 16 on the Billboard Heatseeker Album charts, and received a nomination for a Dove Award, as did the single \"Jesus Muzik\", featuring Trip Lee. In 2007, 116 Clique released its second album, 13 Letters, reaching No. 10 on the Gospel Albums chart and No. 29 on the Christian Albums chart. 116 Clique also released the remix EP Amped, which peaked at No. 24 on the Gospel Albums chart.\\nOn October 8, 2008, Lecrae\\'s third album, Rebel, entered the Billboard charts at No. 60 with 9,800 units sold and topped the Billboard Gospel Album charts for two weeks, the first hip-hop album to do so. It also charted at No. 2 on the Christian Albums chart and No. 15 on the Top Independent charts. In 2009, the album received a nomination at the 40th Dove Awards, as did the Flame song \"Joyful Noise\", which featured Lecrae and John Reilly. 2009 also saw Lecrae\\'s first film role, when he appeared in the documentary Uprise Presents: Word from the Street by the UK-based TV channel OHTV.\\nIn 2009, he moved to Atlanta and he helped establish Blueprint Church (Southern Baptist Convention).\\nOn February 5, 2010, Lecrae released a charity single entitled \"Far Away\", a tribute to the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Lecrae promised that all proceeds from the single\\'s sales would go directly to the Haiti relief effort. On July 7, Lecrae announced on the Reach Records website that the title of his new album would be Rehab. On August 5, 2010, Rapzilla shared a new song from Lecrae called \"Amp It Up\". Lecrae subsequently clarified on his Twitter account that the song was not a single from Rehab, but rather a theme song for Kanakuk Kamps, a chain of Christian camps for which he writes songs annually. On August 31, 2010, Reach Records revealed the track list for Rehab, released it for pre-order, and premiered a promotional video \"Idols\". A second promotional video, entitled \"I Am Dust\", debuted on September 9, 2010. Upon its release, Rehab hit No. 16 on the Billboard 200 chart, making it one of the highest selling Christian hip hop albums at that time.\\nOn September 22, 2010, Rapzilla reported that the Rehab packaging came with an advertisement encouraging buyers to purchase another upcoming album, Rehab: The Overdose, which saw release on January 11, 2011. It included 11 new songs and featured several other Christian artists such as Thi\\'sl and Swoope. Rehab: The Overdose debuted at No. 15 on the Billboard 200. On August 29, 2011, Lecrae announced through Twitter that on September 27, 2011, he would release a special edition of Rehab, entitled Rehab: Deluxe Edition. On the same day, 116 Clique released their fourth album, entitled Man Up. On September 7, 2011, Rapzilla announced that Lecrae would be featured on the BET Hip Hop Awards Cypher on October 11, 2011. Lecrae gained popularity after his verse on the cypher trended nationwide on Twitter and was featured on AllHipHop. Lecrae then appeared as a feature on Statik Selektah\\'s song \"Live and Let Live\" from his Population Control album.\\n\\nMainstream breakthrough (2012–2016)\\nOn February 16, 2012, Rapzilla announced that Lecrae was preparing to release his first mixtape, Church Clothes. On May 3, 2012, Lecrae premiered his music video for the title track of his Church Clothes mixtape online on XXL. The video was noted for including cameos by Kendrick Lamar and DJ Premier, and attracted almost 20,000 views in less than a day. Hosted by Don Cannon, the mixtape featured the song Darkest Hour, in which Lecrae collaborated with No Malice of Clipse. Church Clothes was downloaded more than 100,000 times in less than 48 hours on DatPiff.com, and in less than a month reached 250,000 downloads, a platinum rating on the website. On June 25, 2012, a remastered version of the mixtape, without DJ Don Cannon, was released as an EP for sale on iTunes. Due to issues with sampling, this version was much shorter with only seven songs. Upon its release, the EP debuted on the Billboard charts at No. 10 on both the Christian Albums and Gospel Albums charts for the week of July 14, 2012.\\nOn April 27, Lecrae announced that his next album, Gravity, was to be released in late 2012, and recording sessions began in May. On June 21, 2012, Lecrae appeared live at the Apple Store in Chicago for Black Music Month. The release date for Gravity, September 4, 2012, as well as the album artwork was announced on July 19, 2012, via Rapzilla.\\nOn August 30, 2012, the rapper Saigon announced that Lecrae would be one of the featured artists on his upcoming album The Greatest Story Never Told Chapter 2: Bread and Circuses, due November 6, 2012.\\nGravity was released on September 4, 2012, to critical acclaim. Upon its release, Gravity debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200, with 72,000 units sold. The album also debuted at No. 1 on the Christian, Gospel, Independent, and Rap Album charts, No. 3 on the Digital Albums chart, and 24 on the Canadian Albums Chart. After the iTunes deluxe version of the album hit No. 1 on that vendors charts, and the regular version at number No. 2, Time wrote an article about Lecrae and his success with the album.\\nOn November 7, 2013, Lecrae released his second mixtape, entitled Church Clothes Vol. 2, hosted once again by Don Cannon. The mixtape debuted at No. 21 on the Billboard 200, No. 1 on the Billboard Christian Albums and Gospel Albums charts, and No. 3 on the Rap Albums chart. On Datpiff.com, the album was download over 146,000 times by November 26, 2013.\\nOn June 3, 2014, Lecrae announced through social media that his seventh studio album would be titled Anomaly. The album released on September 9, 2014. It is supported by the single \"Nuthin\". It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with over 88,000 copies sold through the first week. It is the first time an album tops both the Billboard 200 and the Gospel Albums chart. Lecrae also became the fifth artist following Chris Tomlin (2013), TobyMac (2012), LeAnn Rimes (1997) and Bob Carlisle (1997) to score a number one album on both Christian Albums and the Billboard 200. Anomaly also marks the sixth time that Lecrae topped the Gospel Albums chart and the fifth time he topped the Christian Albums chart. In its second week of sales, the album sold 31,000 copies, bringing the total to 120,000 copies sold. In its third week of sales, the album sold another 17,000 copies, bringing the total to 137,000 copies. Anomaly went on to sell over 500,000 copies, and was certified Gold by the RIAA on August 26, 2016. As a reward to fans for their support in helping his album go No. 1 on Billboard, Lecrae released a new song, \"Non-Fiction\", as a free download on September 17. The song was subsequently released on October 21, 2014, in the iTunes store. The single \"All I Need Is You\" from the album was nominated for Best Rap Performance at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, and on June 12, 2019, the song was certified Gold by the RIAA.\\nTo promote Anomaly, on September 18, 2014, Lecrae appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, performing alongside The Roots, the program\\'s house band. He made a subsequent appearance the following year, on January 9, 2015, this time as a featured performer. On January 15, 2016, Lecrae released his third mixtape Church Clothes 3. The mixtape debuted at No. 12 on the Billboard 200 and No. 1 on the Christian, Rap, and Independent charts, selling some 29,207 units.\\n\\nSigning with Columbia and Restoration (2016–present)\\nIn August 2015, Lecrae announced an upcoming memoir titled Unashamed, which on May 3, 2016, was published through B&H Publishing Group, a subsidiary of LifeWay Christian Resources. It opened at No. 19 on The New York Times Best Seller list. In May 2016, Lecrae signed to Columbia Records, which will release future recordings in conjunction with Reach. Lecrae explained that he signed this deal in order to increase the international audience for Reach, since his label peaked nationally with the release of Anomaly. In September 2016, Reach Records announced Lecrae\\'s upcoming tour schedule, The Destination Tour (You\\'re Accepted), which ran through October and November. On October 21, 2016, Lecrae released the single \"Can\\'t Stop Me Now (Destination)\", the lead single from his upcoming studio album. On January 27, 2017, he released the second single \"Blessings\", featuring Ty Dolla Sign. Lecrae followed this up with the third single \"I\\'ll Find You\", featuring Tori Kelly, on June 8, 2017. Then, on June 23, 2017, he released a promotional single \"Hammer Time\", featuring 1K Phew. On August 7, 2017, Lecrae announced his eighth studio album, All Things Work Together, his major label debut. The album was released on September 22, 2017. \"Blessings\" went on to be certified Gold on April 30, 2019, and \"I\\'ll Find You\" was certified Platinum on February 26, 2020.\\nOn May 24, 2018, he announced in a DJ Booth editorial that he and producer Zaytoven would release a collaborative album called Let the Trap Say Amen. The album was released on June 22, 2018. In December 2019, the Atlanta Hawks accidentally leaked information about a new Lecrae album coming March 2020 when they posted about a Lecrae performance—also in March—that included information about the album: Restoration. In an interview with Black Enterprise, Lecrae said that he is excited to put out some healing music, that there is always \"hope, healing, and restoration available if you seek it\". In the same interview, Lecrae discussed his forthcoming second book, I Am Restored: How I Lost My Religion but Found My Faith, which will be a follow-up to his first book Unashamed. I Am Restored will release October 13, 2020. The first single to Restoration, \"Set Me Free\", featuring YK Osiris, and the accompanying music video, was released on March 20, 2020. In May 2020, Lecrae left Columbia, and stated that this would give him more artistic freedom and control. Restoration was released on August 21, 2020. On December 3, 2021, Lecrae released No Church In a While, a ten-track collaboration album with 1K Phew.\\nWith American Christian rapper Andy Mineo, he released \"Coming In Hot\", as a single, and later included on the Reach Records collaborative album titled Summer Eighteen. It has been certified RIAA Digital Gold for more than 500,000 downloads and on-demand streams in August 2021, and Digital Platinum in 2023 for exceeding one million, also becoming a viral song on social networks, even used by personalities like Kim Kardashian and Will Smith. It managed to position itself on Billboard three years after its release, making this a rare phenomenon in music.\\n\\nInfluences and musical style\\nLecrae\\'s musical genre is predominantly Southern hip hop and has been described as falling under the styles of crunk, gangsta rap, and hardcore hip hop. On his third release, Rebel, Lecrae slowed down his style on many songs. Rehab was noted for its stylistic diversity, particularly on the song \"Children of the Light\", which featured Dillavou and Sonny Sandoval and incorporated rock, and reggae influences. With the release Gravity, Billboard described Lecrae as incorporating reggae and soul influences into his \"signature brash sound.\" Let the Trap Say Amen blended Lecrae\\'s spiritual lyrics with Zaytoven\\'s trap-style production.\\nRegarding which musical artists have influenced him, Lecrae, in an interview with Essence, cited Tupac, Nas, DJ Quik, Scarface, and The Cross Movement. In an interview with The Christian Post, Lecrae listed his top favorite five hip hop artists as Tupac, Nas, The Ambassador, Snoop Dogg, and Jay Z, though he admires Jay-Z for his business approach rather than his music. Lecrae also names Outkast and Lauryn Hill as major influences, particularly their albums Aquemini and The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, respectively. He considers Hill\\'s song \"Adam Lives in Theory\" the top song that nourishes him spiritually. In the song \"Non-Fiction\", he lists the Tunnel Rats alongside The Cross Movement as an influence when he was newly converted to Christianity. Theologically, Lecrae follows the Reformed tradition and is considered an influential figure in the New Calvinist movement. He cites Tommy Nelson, John MacArthur, and John Piper, among others, as early influences on his Christian faith, and Lecrae even titled one of his songs, \"Don\\'t Waste Your Life\", after the book of the same name by Piper. Lecrae explains that through Nelson, MacArthur, and Piper, he subsequently discovered Charles Spurgeon, John Calvin, and Francis Schaeffer, the last of whom Lecrae calls his \"personal hero\". Other theologians cited by Lecrae include Tim Keller, Andy Crouch, Randy Alcorn, and Abraham Kuyper. He also looks to Martin Luther King Jr. for inspiration on working out faith in application to social issues.\\nAccording to Miami New Times, he frequently tells the press: \"My music is not Christian, Lecrae is.\"  He continues: \"I think Christian is a wonderful noun, but a terrible adjective. Are there Christian shoes, Christian clothes, Christian plumbers, Christian pipes? I think if you\\'re going to, you should label it hip-hop... hip-hop is a particular poetic style. Labeling it with the faith assumes that the song is going to be some kind of sermon, but there\\'s a lot of social and political things that I don\\'t think make it gospel or Christian music.\" He also stated, \"I like to wrap my mind around a total situation. I\\'m a social anthropologist. If I never been homeless, let me try to be homeless for a week and soak up that information. More like a method actor. So for me it\\'s spending time with people and talking about things from their perspective.\"\\n\\nPopular culture\\nBrooklyn Nets guard Jeremy Lin recommended Lecrae and Hillsong in an interview when asked about his pre-game music. Former NFL quarterback Tim Tebow and professional wrestler Ezekiel Jackson have also endorsed Lecrae. During March 2014, Lecrae signed a ten-day contract with the Atlanta Hawks, and on April 4, 2014, he performed live at Philips Arena after the Hawks game. \"Dum Dum\", a song by Tedashii featuring Lecrae, was used on an episode of So You Think You Can Dance. Lecrae also created the theme song for a new ESPN SportsCenter block called \"Coast to Coast\".\\n\\nSocial activism\\nIn 2011, 116 Clique and ReachLife Ministries, both headed by Lecrae, launched a media campaign titled Man Up, intended to mentor male urban youths on fatherhood and biblical manhood. It features concert tours and a curriculum centered on a short film and a studio album, both titled Man Up, and since 2012 has also featured a string of conference events.\\nIn May 2013, Lecrae partnered with NBA player Dwyane Wade, filmmaker Art Hooker, and Joshua DuBois, the former head of the Office of Faith Based and Neighborhood Partnerships under the Obama administration, to create the national media campaign This Is Fatherhood, an initiative \"devoted to restoring America\\'s commitment to healthy fatherhood.\" The campaign began on May 1 with a \"This is Fatherhood Challenge\", in which contestants could submit videos, songs, and essays about fatherhood through June 10. The winners received cash prizes and a trip to Washington, D.C., for a ceremony on Father\\'s Day. In addition, Lecrae offered studio time and mentoring to the grand prize winner. Lecrae, Wade, DuBois, Jay Z, and U.S. President Barack Obama all made appearances in the campaign\\'s promotional public service announcements.\\nLecrae has also contributed op-ed articles to Billboard dealing with race relations in the United States, including the 2014 Ferguson unrest, 2015 Charleston church shooting, and 2016 shootings of Alton Stirling, Philando Castile, and five Dallas police officers. In these articles, Lecrae has called for understanding and empathy across racial divides and willingness to listen to the oppressed, and also pointed out the need for spiritual healing through Jesus Christ. In mid 2016, Lecrae did a talk about racial reconciliation at Yale University, titled \"Knowledge through Narrative: Bridging the Racial Divide in America\". He also spoke on hip hop culture at a Nashville TEDx conference, decrying the misogyny and violence rampant in much of hip hop\\'s lyrics but advocating for hip hop to be used as an agent for social change. At the 2016 BET Hip Hop Awards, Lecrae performed an original composition addressing racial injustice in the United States, referencing the shooting of Philando Castile.\\nIn March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Lecrae worked with a local non-profit, Love Beyond Walls, to distribute hand-washing stations and food to homeless people in Atlanta. He also wrote an essay for Billboard in which he discussed the need for humane behavior in the midst of widespread social panic due to the outbreak. After the murder of George Floyd, Lecrae was inspired to write \"Deep End\", which was a late addition to Restoration.\\nLecrae also serves on the board of Peace Preparatory Academy in Atlanta, a nonprofit school dedicated to the care of those in their school and in their community.\\n\\nOther business ventures\\nLecrae has partnered with Oust Labs to be an investor and co-owner of the audio production software MXD, which was founded by Jacob \"Biz\" Morris. In 2020, Lecrae teamed up with Adam Thomason to found the film production studio 3 Strand Films. He is a venture partner in Collab Capital, and has participated in several real estate ventures, including Invest Atlanta and Peace Preparatory Academy, intended to revitalize English Avenue.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nLecrae currently resides in Atlanta since relocating there from Memphis in 2009, and is married to Darragh Moore. The couple have three children together. In an interview with HipHopDX, Lecrae stated that Clipse member No Malice sought him out as a spiritual advisor. On October 20, 2016, Lecrae wrote in The Huffington Post that he has been struggling with depression and doubt, which was partly caused by the backlash he received from many American evangelicals who are critical of his public stance on race-related issues. On August 14, 2020, Lecrae posted a video on his YouTube channel that includes footage of him re-connecting with his long-absent father who now resides in San Diego.\\n\\nDiscography\\nReal Talk (2004)\\nAfter the Music Stops (2006)\\nRebel (2008)\\nRehab (2010)\\nRehab: The Overdose (2011)\\nGravity (2012)\\nAnomaly (2014)\\nAll Things Work Together (2017)\\nLet the Trap Say Amen (with Zaytoven) (2018)\\nRestoration (2020)\\nNo Church in a While (with 1k Phew) (2021)\\n\\nProduction discography\\nSelf-release – Real Talk (2004) – Executive producer with John K.

Stone was the youngest woman on the 2006 Sunday Times Rich List—an annual list of the UK\\'s wealthiest people—with £6 million. In 2012, her net worth was estimated to be £10 million, making her the fifth richest British musician under 30. The Soul Sessions Vol. 2 (2012) is her fourth consecutive album to reach the top 10 on the Billboard 200.\\n\\nEarly life\\nJoscelyn Eve Stoker was born on 11 April 1987 at Buckland Hospital in Dover, Kent, and spent her teenage years in Ashill, a small village near Cullompton in Devon. She is the third of four children born to Wendy (née Skillin) and Richard Stoker. Her father owns a fruit and nut import–export business; her mother worked as Stone\\'s manager until October 2004. Stone made her first public appearance at the Uffculme Comprehensive School, which she attended, in Uffculme, Devon, with a cover version of Jackie Wilson\\'s 1957 song \"Reet Petite\". Stone has dyslexia and left school at age sixteen with three GCSE qualifications. \"It wasn\\'t that I was stupid. I\\'m just a little bit dyslexic and I wasn\\'t very academic. I\\'m more artistic\", she says.\\nStone grew up listening to a wide variety of music including 1960s and 1970s American R&B and soul music performed by such artists as Dusty Springfield and Aretha Franklin. As a result, she developed a soulful style of singing like her idols. \"My first CD that I owned was Aretha Franklin: Greatest Hits. And I saw the advert on TV and it was just like little clips of her songs. I had no idea who she was—I was only like 10 so. I said, \\'Oh yeah, that looks really good\\', so I wrote it down and I said to my mum, \\'Can I have that for Christmas?\\' So she told my friend Dennis, who always gets me good music anyway, and he got that for me. So that was one of my first albums that I loved.\" She would later tell MTV News: \"I kind of clicked into soul music more than anything else because of the vocals. You\\'ve got to have good vocals to sing soul music and I always liked it ever since I was little.\"\\n\\nCareer\\n2001–2003: Beginnings and The Soul Sessions\\nIn 2001, aged 13, Stone auditioned for the BBC Television talent show Star for a Night in London, singing Aretha Franklin\\'s 1968 Goffin-King hit \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\" and Whitney Houston\\'s 1999 single, \"It\\'s Not Right but It\\'s Okay\". After passing her audition, she sang Donna Summer\\'s  \"On the Radio\" for the broadcast, and eventually won the contest. She also appeared on and won Steps to the Stars (a TV programme hosted by H & Claire of the group Steps). Stone then performed on a charity show, where she drew the attention of the Boilerhouse Boys, composed of London-based producers Andy Dean and Ben Wolfe, who contacted S-Curve Records founder and CEO, Steve Greenberg in December 2001 telling him \"they had just heard the greatest singer they\\'d ever heard from their country\". In early 2002, Greenberg flew Stone to New York for an audition, in which she sang to backing tracks of classic soul songs: Otis Redding\\'s 1968 \"(Sittin\\' On) The Dock of the Bay\", Gladys Knight & the Pips\\' 1973 \"Midnight Train to Georgia\", and Franklin\\'s \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\"; Greenberg instantly signed her to his label.\\nAfter being signed by S-Curve Records, her US market album was released by S-Curve Records and in the international market her album was released by EMI Music. Stone flew to Miami and Philadelphia to start work on her debut album, The Soul Sessions, released on 16 September 2003. She collaborated with people with solid credentials in the Miami soul scene such as Betty Wright, Benny Latimore, Timmy Thomas and Little Beaver as well as contemporary acts Angie Stone and the Roots. The album, produced by Steve Greenberg, Mike Mangini and Betty Wright, consists of little-known soul tracks by Franklin, Laura Lee, Bettye Swann and others. Released in late 2003, it reached the top five on the UK Albums Chart as well as the top forty of the US Billboard 200 chart. The lead single, \"Fell in Love with a Boy\", a reworking of the White Stripes\\' 2001 \"Fell in Love with a Girl\", reached the top 20 of the UK Singles Chart, as did the second single, a cover version of Sugar Billy\\'s 1974 song \"Super Duper Love (Are You Diggin\\' on Me)\". The album eventually went triple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry in mid-April 2005 and gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in late March 2004.\\n\\n2004–2006: Mind Body & Soul and film debut\\nAfter achieving critical acclaim with The Soul Sessions, Stone worked on new material, and recorded her second album, Mind Body & Soul, which was released on 28 September 2004, produced by the same team as her first album. She called the album her real debut. It debuted at No. one in the UK, breaking the record for the youngest female ever to top the UK Albums Chart, and just missed the top ten of the US Billboard 200 after peaking at No. 11. The lead single, \"You Had Me\", became her biggest hit to date when it rose to No. 9 in the UK. Follow-up singles \"Right to Be Wrong\" and \"Spoiled\" both made the top 40, and \"Don\\'t Cha Wanna Ride\", the top 20. \"Spoiled\" landed just outside the top 50 of US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, peaking at No. 54. In early September 2005, Mind, Body & Soul was certified triple platinum by the BPI and platinum by the RIAA.\\nIn April 2004, Stone performed during the VH1\\'s benefit concert Divas Live 2004 alongside Ashanti, Cyndi Lauper, Gladys Knight, Jessica Simpson and Patti LaBelle, in support of the Save the Music Foundation. Stone joined Band Aid 20 on 14 November 2004 in benefit of Sudan\\'s troubled Darfur region. The group, which included Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin and U2 lead singer Bono, re-recorded the 1984 song \"Do They Know It\\'s Christmas?\", written by Band Aid organisers Bob Geldof and Midge Ure. Stone, who was born two years after the release of the original single, was not initially aware of who Bob Geldof was, with media reporting that she repeatedly referred to him as Bob Gandalf. Despite some criticism, the single became the UK\\'s biggest-selling single of 2004 as well as the 2004 Christmas number-one single.\\nAt the 2005 BRIT Awards, Stone won for British Female Solo Artist and British Urban Act—entering the Guinness World Records as the youngest BRIT Award solo winner at age seventeen, and was nominated for British Breakthrough Act. She also received a nomination for Best UK Act of the Year at the 2005 MOBO Awards, as well as three nominations for the 2005 Grammy Awards—Best New Artist, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"You Had Me\", and Best Pop Vocal Album for Mind Body & Soul, where she sang with rock performer Melissa Etheridge, in tribute to blues-rock singer Janis Joplin. Their performance of \"Cry Baby/Piece of My Heart\" was released as a single, and through the aid of strong digital download sales, became Stone\\'s first single to enter the US Billboard Hot 100, when it debuted and peaked at No. 32 the week of 2 April 2005.\\n\\nIn March 2005, Stone was named the spokesperson for the Gap clothing company, replacing the actress Sarah Jessica Parker. She appeared in a television advertisement for that store chain singing a cover of Ray Charles\\'s 1958 song \"Night Time Is the Right Time\" (retitled \"The Right Time\"). Stone also appeared in one of Gap\\'s Fall 2005 \"Favorites\" commercials, singing the Beach Boys\\' 1966 song \"God Only Knows\". By that time, rumours circulated about her being dropped from the campaign because she was living with then-25-year-old songwriter and producer Beau Dozier (son of Motown producer and composer Lamont Dozier) in Los Angeles while she was only 17. However, Gap later denied the rumours, stating that they were very happy with Stone and telling BBC Radio 1 that the claims were \"absolute tosh\" and \"a complete fabrication\". On 11 April 2005, Stone performed \"Spoiled\", Rufus\\' 1974 song \"Tell Me Something Good\" with John Legend, Otis Redding\\'s 1966 song \"Try a Little Tenderness\" with Donna Summer, and 1977\\'s \"Hot Legs\" with Rod Stewart at \"Save the Music: A Concert to Benefit the VH1 Save the Music Foundation\", in benefit of VH1\\'s Save the Music Foundation. Three months later, on 2 July 2005, Stone performed \"Super Duper Love\", \"I Had a Dream\", and \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" at the Live 8 concert at Hyde Park, London. Stone was an opening act for the Rolling Stones during their 2005 A Bigger Bang tour.\\nStone performed a medley of \"It\\'s a Man\\'s World\" and \"Papa\\'s Got a Brand New Bag\" with James Brown on BBC One\\'s chat show Friday Night with Jonathan Ross on 1 July 2005. Stone collaborated with jazz pianist Herbie Hancock and blues singer-guitarist Jonny Lang on a cover of U2\\'s 1988 song \"When Love Comes to Town\" for Hancock\\'s 2005 album Possibilities. That same year, Stone was featured along with Sean Paul on Santana\\'s \"Cry Baby Cry\", and worked on a remake of Patti LaBelle\\'s 1985 song \"Stir It Up\" for the soundtrack to the Disney animated film Chicken Little. She also collaborated with Lemar in 2006 on his third studio album, The Truth About Love, on the track \"Anniversary\".\\nOn 5 February 2006, Stone joined Stevie Wonder, India.Arie, and John Legend during the Super Bowl XL pre-game ceremonies to perform a medley of Wonder\\'s hits. Three days later, on 8 February, on the night of the 2006 Grammy Awards, she helped perform a medley of Sly & the Family Stone\\'s hits alongside Legend, Ciara, Maroon 5, will.i.am, Robert Randolph, Steven Tyler and Joe Perry. Stone made her film debut in the fantasy adventure film Eragon (based on the 2003 novel of the same name by Christopher Paolini), directed by Stefen Fangmeier and released on 15 December 2006, playing the fortune teller Angela. At the 2007 Grammy Awards, Stone shared the award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for her collaboration with John Legend and Van Hunt on their 2005 cover of Sly & the Family Stone\\'s 1971 chart-topper \"Family Affair\".\\n\\n2007–2008: Introducing Joss Stone\\nStone caused controversy at the 2007 BRIT Awards ceremony on 14 February 2007 while presenting the award for British Male Solo Artist (won by James Morrison). Speaking in an American accent, she circled the podium and gave a speech about Robbie Williams, who had been the target of earlier jokes made by host Russell Brand. Williams had been reported as going into rehabilitation that same week. As her speech continued, she made remarks about Brand, implying that he was heading for rehabilitation himself (while singing a passage of Amy Winehouse\\'s hit \"Rehab\"). In response to the British media\\'s reaction, Stone responded, \"At the end of the day, I don\\'t give a fuck if people have a problem with my accent. That\\'s all I can say about it. The words I say do not change. If the way that it sounds is skew-wiff and you don\\'t like it, don\\'t listen. I\\'m not being a cruel person by sounding a different way. And I can\\'t help it. I\\'ve been [in America working] since I was, like, 14.\" Stone later claimed that her record label cancelled all her upcoming press appearances to publicise her upcoming third album as a result of the backlash.\\n\\nStone began work on her third studio album, Introducing Joss Stone, at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas, in May 2006. Released on 12 March 2007, the album was coordinated by A&R Chris Anokute, produced by Raphael Saadiq, and included collaborations with Lauryn Hill, Common, and Joi. Virgin Records describes the album as \"an electrifying mix of warm vintage soul, 1970s-style R&B, Motown girl-group harmonies, and hip-hop grooves\". Stone herself describes it as \"truly me. That\\'s why I\\'m calling it Introducing Joss Stone. These are my words, and this is who I am as an artist.\" She also revealed on The Tavis Smiley Show that her break-up with Beau Dozier was a source of inspiration while writing Introducing Joss Stone. The album debuted and peaked at No. 12 on the UK Albums Chart, not managing to match the success of Stone\\'s two previous albums. It nevertheless debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 selling 118,000 copies in its first week, becoming the highest debut for a British solo female artist on the US chart, surpassing the record previously held by Amy Winehouse with Back to Black (which in turn would later be outdone by Leona Lewis, whose album Spirit debuted at No. 1 the week of 26 April 2008).\\n\"Tell Me \\'Bout It\", the album\\'s lead single, debuted and peaked at No. 28 on the UK Singles Chart. The second single, \"Tell Me What We\\'re Gonna Do Now\", a collaboration with rapper Common, failed to chart inside the UK top seventy-five. Stone and Common turned the single\\'s music video into a Product Red, reverting 100% of the gains from copies of the video purchased from iTunes to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Stone is the first Product Red artist to do so. Stone also sampled Franklin\\'s \"Respect\", taking the texture and sound of the song, but keeping her own composition. \"Baby Baby Baby\" was released digitally in December 2007 and physically in January 2008 as the third single. In support of the album, Stone embarked on a North American tour which began on 27 April at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard, Connecticut and ended on 13 June at the Filene Center in Vienna, Virginia, visiting sixteen cities in total including Philadelphia, San Francisco, Vancouver, Chicago, Toronto, New York and Boston. Two months later, she went on a North American late-summer tour which kicked off on 27 August at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles and ended on 29 September at the Crossroads in Kansas City, Missouri, covering twelve cities—this time including Mexico City.\\n\\n2009–2010: Colour Me Free! and departure from EMI\\nStone was photographed by Canadian singer-guitarist and photographer Bryan Adams for Phonak\\'s Hear the World initiative, whose main goal is to raise global awareness for the topic of hearing and hearing loss. On 7 July 2007, Stone performed at the South African leg of the Live Earth concerts at the Coca-Cola Dome in Johannesburg, to promote awareness of global warming. She sang the Introducing Joss Stone tracks \"Girl They Won\\'t Believe It\", \"Headturner\", \"Tell Me What We\\'re Gonna Do Now\", \"Music\", and \"Tell Me \\'bout It\", as well as Mind, Body & Soul\\'s \"Right to Be Wrong\" and \"Gimme Shelter\", the latter with Angélique Kidjo. In a 2022 interview, Stone said \"Right to Be Wrong\" is the song she is most attached to as she wrote it with late Betty Wright.\\nStone covered Nat King Cole\\'s 1965 song \"L-O-V-E\" for an advertising campaign for Chanel\\'s Coco Mademoiselle fragrance.\\nOn 29 November 2007, Stone joined Jeff Beck on a duet of the Impressions\\'s 1965 song \"People Get Ready\" as part of his series of concerts at London\\'s Ronnie Scott\\'s Jazz Club, documented on the DVD Performing This Week: Live at Ronnie Scott\\'s. To raise the awareness of AIDS, Annie Lennox joined forces with twenty-three female acts (including Stone) and recorded the song \"Sing\", which was released on World AIDS Day on 1 December 2007, when Lennox performed at one of Nelson Mandela\\'s 46664 concerts at Johannesburg\\'s Ellis Park Stadium. In mid-December 2007, Stone was named the new Flake girl to star in a series of television adverts for the Cadbury Schweppes product in the spring of 2008. According to the company, she is the first non-model to take the role.\\nIn March 2008, Stone landed the role of lesbian bingo caller Stephanie in the British romantic comedy film Snappers, for which she also wrote music. However, the film was never released. Stone made her television debut portraying Henry VIII\\'s fourth wife Anne of Cleves in the third season of the Showtime series The Tudors. She reprised the role in the show\\'s final season in 2010, appearing in two episodes.\\nStone launched a legal battle in a bid to leave her record label, EMI, and free her of her current three-album deal with the record label in April 2008. Stone performed at the 19th Annual GLAAD Media Awards at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles on 26 April 2008. She also performed \"Right to Be Wrong\" at the LA PRIDE 2008—produced by Christopher Street West, a non-profit organisation in West Hollywood, California, on 7 June 2008. On 26 October 2008, Stone sang the British national anthem, \"God Save the Queen\", before the NFL match between the San Diego Chargers and the New Orleans Saints, held at Wembley Stadium in London.\\n\\nOn 7 December 2008, Stone performed the Who\\'s 1965 song \"My Generation\" on CBS\\'s Kennedy Center Honors TV special at the Kennedy Center, Washington, D.C., honouring Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey.

In late 2010, Stone\\'s voice and likeness were used for the \"Bond girl\" character of Nicole Hunter, a jewellery designer and MI6 agent, in the video game James Bond 007: Blood Stone. In addition to portraying the character, she also performed the game\\'s theme song, \"I\\'ll Take It All\", which was co-written and performed with Dave Stewart.\\nIn 2010, Stone provided vocals on two songs for the charity-focused audio drama production, A Voyage For Soldier Miles. The songs are \"Lover Earth\" written by Dave Stewart and Mark Warford and \"Never Gonna Be The Same\" written and performed by Mark Warford and Niels Lan Doky.\\nStone\\'s fourth studio album was written and recorded in about a week in Devon in early 2008. She said: \"It\\'s very, very raw. It\\'s a bunch of musicians, writers and myself, and we\\'re just jamming, basically.\" In promotion of the album, entitled Colour Me Free!, Stone played concerts throughout the UK in February and March. Originally scheduled for release in April 2009, Colour Me Free! was finally released on 20 October 2009. Stone said that her record company also fought her about the original cover of her new album, calling it \"offensive\". It was changed to simple text and no picture of Stone on the American edition. The original cover was used on the other editions worldwide. In late August 2010, it was reported that Stone had left EMI and formed her own independent record label, Stone\\'d Records. EMI announced in late December that they would be releasing a greatest hits album, The Best of Joss Stone 2003–2009.

The debut single, \"Miracle Worker\", was released on 19 July 2011.\\nReleased in July 2012, The Soul Sessions Vol. 2 saw Stone return to her original label, S-Curve Records, who released the album jointly with the artist\\'s Stone\\'d Records, and features production from Steve Greenberg (producer of the first \"Soul Sessions\"). The album finds Stone largely covering lesser-known soul songs from the 1970s and 1980s by acts including the Chi-Lites, the Honey Cone, the Dells, Sylvia, Labi Siffre and Linda Lewis.

              " 'Robyn Rihanna Fenty (  ree-AN-ə; born February 20, 1988) is a Barbadian singer, businesswoman and actress based in the United States. She was  cited as the best-selling female recording artist of the 21st century by Guinness World Records and is one of the best-selling recording artists of all time, with sales estimated at 250 million units worldwide. Rihanna is the highest-certified female digital single artist and the only female artist to have seven U.S. diamond certified singles. She has achieved 14 number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. The recipient of numerous awards and nominations, Rihanna remains the wealthiest female musical artist with an estimated net worth of $1.4 billion as of 2024.\\nRihanna signed with Def Jam Recordings in 2005 and found mainstream recognition following the release of her first two studio albums, Music of the Sun (2005) and A Girl Like Me (2006). Both influenced by Caribbean music, the albums peaked within the top ten on the US Billboard 200 chart. Her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), incorporated elements of dance-pop, and established her status as a pop icon. Its lead single \"Umbrella\" peaked atop the US Billboard Hot 100 and won her first Grammy Award.\\nRihanna continued to blend pop, dance, and R&B influences on her next albums, Rated R (2009), Loud (2010), Talk That Talk (2011), and Unapologetic (2012)—the latter of which peaked the Billboard 200. The albums spawned the Billboard Hot 100-number one singles \"Rude Boy\", \"Only Girl (In the World)\", \"What\\'s My Name?\", \"S&M\", \"We Found Love\", and \"Diamonds\". Her eighth album, Anti (2016), showcased new creative control following her departure from Def Jam in favor of Jay-Z\\'s label, Roc Nation. Becoming her second US number one album, it was supported by the chart-topping single \"Work\". Throughout her career, Rihanna has worked with artists including Coldplay, Drake, Eminem, Kanye West, Ne-Yo, and Shakira.\\nAside from music, Rihanna is recognized for her humanitarian involvement, \\nentrepreneurship, and fashion industry influence. She established the Clara Lionel Foundation, cosmetics brand Fenty Beauty, and fashion house Fenty under LVMH, becoming the first black woman to lead a luxury brand for LVMH. Rihanna has acted in major roles in Battleship (2012), Home (2015), Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017), and Ocean\\'s 8 (2018). In 2018, she was appointed as an ambassador by the Government of Barbados and declared a National Hero of Barbados in 2021.\\n\\nEarly life\\nRobyn Rihanna Fenty was born on February 20, 1988, in Saint Michael, Barbados. She is the daughter of accountant Monica (née Braithwaite) and warehouse supervisor Ronald Fenty. Her mother is Afro-Guyanese, while her father is a Barbadian of African, Irish, English, and Scottish descent. Rihanna has two brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty, and two half-sisters and a half-brother from her father\\'s side, each born to different mothers from his previous relationships. She grew up in a three-bedroom bungalow in Bridgetown and sold clothes with her father in a stall on the street. Her childhood was deeply affected by her father\\'s alcoholism and crack-cocaine addiction, which contributed to her parents\\' strained marriage. Rihanna\\'s father used to abuse her mother physically, and Rihanna would try to get in between them to break up fights.\\nAs a child, Rihanna had many CT scans for the excruciating headaches that she suffered, recalling, \"The doctors even thought it was a tumor, because it was that intense.\" By the time she was 14, her parents had divorced, and her health began to improve. She grew up listening to reggae music. She attended Charles F. Broome Memorial Primary School and Combermere School, where she studied alongside future international cricketers Chris Jordan and Carlos Brathwaite. At age 11, Rihanna was a cadet in Barbados\\'s Cadet Corps; the later Barbadian singer-songwriter Shontelle was her drill sergeant. She initially wanted to graduate from high school, but she chose to pursue a musical career instead.\\n\\nMusic career\\n2003–2006: Beginnings and early releases\\nIn 2003, Rihanna formed a musical trio with two of her classmates in her home country of Barbados. Without a name or any material, the girl group auditioned with American record producer Evan Rogers, who commented, \"The minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didn\\'t exist.\" Rihanna later performed renditions of Destiny\\'s Child\\'s \"Emotion\" and Mariah Carey\\'s \"Hero\". Impressed, Rogers scheduled a second meeting with Rihanna\\'s mother present and then invited Rihanna to his hometown in the United States to record some demo tapes that could be sent to record labels. Recordings were intermittent, taking about a year because she was only able to record during school holidays. \"Pon de Replay\" and \"The Last Time\" were two tracks recorded for the demo tape, which were eventually included on her debut album Music of the Sun. That same year, Rihanna was signed to Rogers\\'s and Carl Sturken\\'s production company, Syndicated Rhythm Productions.\\nRihanna\\'s demo was shipped out to Def Jam Recordings, where Jay Brown, an A&R executive at the record label, was one of the first to hear the demo. Brown played the demo tape for rapper Jay-Z, who had recently been appointed as president and CEO of Def Jam. When Jay-Z first heard the track \"Pon de Replay\", he felt the song was too big for her. Despite being skeptical, he invited Rihanna to audition for the label. In early 2005, Rihanna auditioned for Def Jam in New York City, where Jay-Z introduced her to music mogul Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid. At the audition, she sang Whitney Houston\\'s cover of \"For the Love of You\", as well as the demo tracks \"Pon de Replay\" and \"The Last Time\". Jay-Z was absolutely certain about signing her after she performed her future single \"Pon de Replay\". His boss, L.A. Reid, was also impressed with her audition, telling Jay-Z not to let Rihanna leave the building until the contract was signed. Reid left it to Jay-Z and his team to close the deal which resulted in a six-album record deal with Def Jam. She waited in Jay-Z\\'s office until 3:00 in the morning to get lawyers to draft up a contract because he wanted to prevent her from signing with another label.\\nRihanna canceled other meetings with record labels and relocated from Barbados to the United States to live with Rogers and his wife.\\n\\nAfter signing with Def Jam, Jay-Z and his team did the A&R for Rihanna\\'s debut album and spent the next three months recording and completing her debut album. She worked with different producers to complete her debut studio album, primarily Rogers and his production partner Carl Sturken. With several songs to pick as a lead single, \"Pon de Replay\" was chosen because it seemed like the best song suited for a summer release. In May 2005, her debut single, \"Pon de Replay\", was released under her mononym \"Rihanna\". It charted successfully worldwide, peaking in the top five in fifteen countries, including at No. 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart. The song became a club hit in the United States, peaking at No. 1 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs.\\nMusic of the Sun was released in August 2005. It debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard 200 and received a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of over 500,000 units. The album sold over 2 million copies worldwide. A second single, \"If It\\'s Lovin\\' that You Want\", was not as successful as its predecessor, but reached the top 10 in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand. Aside from her work in music, Rihanna made her acting debut in a cameo role in the successful straight-to-DVD film Bring It On: All or Nothing, released in August 2006.\\nA month after the release of her debut album, Rihanna began working on her second studio album. A Girl like Me was released in April 2006. Rolling Stone felt that \"the burning rock guitar\" and haunted strings of some of the album\\'s tracks made \"A Girl like Me [...] likable.\" The album was a commercial success, charting in the top 10 in 13 countries. The album reached No. 1 in Canada and No. 5 in the United Kingdom and the United States, where it sold 115,000 copies in its first week. The album became Rihanna\\'s first to be certified Platinum by the RIAA, after selling over 1,000,000 units. Its lead single, \"SOS\", was an international success, charting in the top five in 11 countries. The song reached No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and in Australia, her first to reach this chart position. \"Unfaithful\", the album\\'s second single, reached the top 10 in 18 countries, including No. 1 in Canada and Switzerland. Two more singles were released from the album: \"We Ride\" and \"Break It Off\".\\n\\n2007–2008: Breakthrough with Good Girl Gone Bad\\nIn early 2007, Rihanna appeared on the single \"Roll It\" with Jamaican band J-Status and fellow Barbadian singer-songwriter Shontelle. The song appeared on J-Status\\' debut album The Beginning, released in several European countries only. Around that time, Rihanna had already begun work on her third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad. With the help of producers Timbaland, Tricky Stewart and Sean Garrett she embraced a new musical direction through uptempo dance tracks. Released in May 2007, the album charted at No. 2 in Australia and the US and topped the charts in multiple countries, including Brazil, Canada, Ireland and the UK. The album received the most positive critical reviews of her first three albums.\\n\\nThe lead single, \"Umbrella\", topped the charts in 13 countries and remained at No. 1 in the UK for 10 consecutive weeks, the longest-running No. 1 single there since Wet Wet Wet\\'s single \"Love Is All Around\" spent 15 weeks at the top in 1994. It was Rihanna\\'s first single to be named one of the best-selling singles worldwide, with sales of over 8 million copies. The songs \"Shut Up and Drive\", \"Hate That I Love You\" (featuring Ne-Yo), and \"Don\\'t Stop the Music\" were also released as singles, with the latter becoming an international hit. In support of the album, Rihanna began the Good Girl Gone Bad Tour in September 2007, with 80 shows across the US, Canada, and Europe. Rihanna was nominated for several 2008 Grammy Awards for Good Girl Gone Bad, winning Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Umbrella\" alongside Jay-Z, her first Grammy Award.\\nOn June 9, 2008, Rihanna released Good Girl Gone Bad Live, her first live long-form video.

By late 2008, Rihanna still remained on the charts with the release of the fifth single from Good Girl Gone Bad, \"Rehab\", and was named \"Diva of the Year\" by Entertainment Weekly for her \"newfound staying power\". Good Girl Gone Bad has sold over 2.8 million units in the United States alone, receiving a two-times-Platinum certification from the RIAA. It is Rihanna\\'s bestselling album in the country to date. The album has sold 9 million units worldwide.\\nDuring the late 2000s, Rihanna experimented further with pop, dubstep, and rock music, officially shifting her musical style and image away from the Barbados island girl. Throughout 2008, Rihanna performed on the Glow in the Dark Tour alongside Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, and N.E.R.D. Her third studio album\\'s reissue, Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded, was released in June 2008 with three new songs: \"Disturbia\", \"Take a Bow\" and the Maroon 5 duet \"If I Never See Your Face Again\", plus a Spanglish version of \"Hate That I Love You\" featuring Spanish pop singer David Bisbal. All four were released as singles and charted highly, reaching peak positions worldwide. In August 2008, Rihanna and a host of other female singers recorded the charity single \"Just Stand Up!\", the theme song to the anti-cancer campaign Stand Up to Cancer. \"Live Your Life\", a duet between T.I. and Rihanna, was released that November and topped the Billboard Hot 100.\\n\\n2009–2011: Rated R and Loud\\nOn February 8, 2009, Rihanna\\'s scheduled performance at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards was canceled.\\nReports surfaced that then-boyfriend, singer Chris Brown, had physically assaulted her. He was arrested on suspicion of making criminal threats. On March 5, 2009, Brown was charged with assault and making criminal threats.

In December 2018, Rihanna confirmed that the album would be released in 2019, and later announced that it is a reggae project. In August 2019, fans noticed that Rihanna and co-songwriters Collin Edwards, Monique Lawrence, and Alexander Ogunmokun registered a song titled \"Private Loving\" with the music publishing organization BMI. In September 2019, it was announced that she had signed with Sony/ATV Music Publishing. In December 2019, Rihanna alluded to her album being complete and indefinitely withholding the release date in an Instagram post. In her 2023 British Vogue interview, when asked about her ninth studio album, she said: \"When you come off of an album like Anti ... there\\'s this pressure that I put on myself. That if it\\'s not better than that then it is not even worth it\", noting that \"it\\'s not the right way to look at music\" and \"if I keep waiting until this feels right and perfect and better, maybe it\\'s going to keep taking forever and maybe it\\'ll never come out and no, I\\'m not down to that.\"\\nDuring this period, Rihanna appeared on Canadian singer PartyNextDoor\\'s song \"Believe It\", which was released on March 27, 2020. On October 28, 2022, she released the lead single from the Black Panther: Wakanda Forever soundtrack, \"Lift Me Up\", her first solo musical release since Anti. The song earned her nominations for the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Original Song.

The show had a mostly positive reception. It was initially reported that the performance gained a total of 118.7 million viewers across television and digital platforms, however the figure was later revised by Nielsen Media Research, who adjusted the number to 121.017 million viewers, making it the most-watched halftime show in history, surpassing Katy Perry\\'s performance at the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show.\\n\\nArtistry\\nMusic and voice\\nRihanna is a mezzo-soprano, with a range spanning from B2 to C♯6. While recording tracks for her third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), Rihanna took vocal lessons from Ne-Yo. She said of the experience, \"I\\'ve never had vocal training, so when I\\'m in the studio, he\\'ll tell me how to breathe and stuff... He\\'ll call out these big fancy words: \\'OK, I want you to do staccato.\\' And I\\'m like, \\'OK, I don\\'t know what that is.\\'\" Her vocal performance on Loud (2010) received positive reviews from music critics. James Skinner from BBC praised Rihanna\\'s vocals on the song \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\" and wrote that her voice is powerful and that \"it is Rihanna\\'s vocal – at once commanding, soulful and vulnerable – that anchors the song, and Loud itself\". Andy Gill from The Independent feels that \"California King Bed\" features her best vocal performance. In a review of Unapologetic, Billboard magazine wrote, \"Diamonds finds Rihanna doing one of her throatiest, most impassioned vocals to date, on this inspirational pop ballad.\" Jon Caramanica of the New York Times stated, \"over the years, as her game face froze in place, her voice cured into a weapon of emotional chill and strategic indifference. It\\'s decidedly unfriendly, made to give orders\". In 2023, Rolling Stone ranked Rihanna at number 68 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.\\n\\nGrowing up in Barbados, she mainly listened to reggae, hip hop and soca music. When she first came to the US, she was exposed to different types of music with \"rock being one of them, and I fell in love with it. [Now] I love rock music.\" During her debut, she recorded songs that were inspired by her Caribbean roots and described her early sound as \"a fusion of reggae, hip-hop and R&B, with a little something different thrown in\". Her early dancehall roots can be found on her debut album, Music of the Sun, and its follow-up, A Girl like Me. Her debut album demonstrates the influence of Rihanna\\'s musical heritage of the Caribbean. Kelefa Sanneh of the New York Times complimented its combination of dancehall and reggae, who said, \"Dancehall reggae sometimes seems like a furiously insular form of music, but ... Rihanna is only the latest singer to discover how versatile the genre\\'s spring-loaded electronic rhythms can be\". Her debut single, \"Pon de Replay\" features a dancehall-pop mixture that infuses a reggae style, while \"If It\\'s Lovin\\' that You Want\" talks about a girl seducing a guy to be her boyfriend. Aiming for artistic growth, A Girl like Me expresses personal experiences that typical 18-year-old girls go through with ballads that were described as elegant and mature. After her second album, she slowly dismissed her dancehall and reggae roots.\\nRihanna\\'s musical career has been an experiment with new musical ideas and stated that she wants \"to make music that could be heard in parts of the world that I\\'d never been to\". With its provocative subject matter and lyrics, she began incorporating a wide range of genres including, pop, R&B, reggae, dubstep, hip hop and EDM. During a review for Good Girl Gone Bad, Slant Magazine to write that Rihanna \"finally figured out that she\\'s a dance artist and the majority of the album is comprised of uptempo dance-pop [songs like]\" \"Push Up on Me\" and \"Don\\'t Stop the Music\". It represents a departure from the Caribbean sound of her previous albums and is described as a turning point in her career. While the first half of the record shares many 1980s pop influences with songs like \"Don\\'t Stop the Music\" and \"Shut Up and Drive\", the second half retreats into standard R&B.\\nRecorded after the assault by her then-boyfriend, Chris Brown, Rated R had a much darker tone and was filled with various emotions she experienced throughout 2009. In her fifth album Loud, Rihanna reflects on the fun and energetic vibe she had while recording the album. The album is a mixture of ballads, party anthems and empowering love songs. Talk That Talk was similar to Rated R, as both contain hip hop, R&B, dancehall and dubstep genres. Loud and Talk That Talk saw her explore sexuality in her work (\"S&M\" and \"Birthday Cake\") and return to her dancehall roots (\"Man Down\" and \"Watch n\\' Learn\"). She also branched out into house music with tracks like \"We Found Love\", \"Only Girl (In the World)\" and \"Complicated\". Her songs are also inspired through record sampling from other artists.\\n\\nInfluences\\nRihanna has named Madonna as her idol and biggest influence. She said that she wanted to be the \"black Madonna\" and praised her ability to reinvent herself throughout her career. She noted, \"I think that Madonna was a great inspiration for me, especially on my earlier work. If I had to examine her evolution through time, I think she reinvented her clothing style and music with success every single time. And at the same time remained a real force in entertainment in the whole world.\"\\nAnother major influence on Rihanna\\'s music and career has been Mariah Carey, whose song \"Hero\" she performed when Rihanna was still a teenager at her high school talent show. She revealed that Carey\\'s song \"Vision of Love\" \"was the song that made [her] want to do music.\"\\nIn her youth, she would see Bob Marley on television because of his fame in the Caribbean. She stated, \"He\\'s one of my favourite artists of all time – he really paved the way for every other artist out of the Caribbean\". She built a shrine in her home dedicated to the reggae legend and has covered Marley\\'s \"Is This Love\" and Bob Marley & The Wailers\\' \"Redemption Song\" during her concert tours.\\nDuring her childhood, she would go around singing Whitney Houston songs and \"A Whole New World\" into her hairbrush so much that her neighbors started calling her \"Robyn Redbreast\". She also stated that one of the first songs she remembers falling in love with was Houston\\'s version of \"I Will Always Love You\" and that it \"was really inspiring, and it made me develop a passion for music, so really, she\\'s partly responsible for me being here in this industry.\"\\nRihanna was also influenced by Janet Jackson, Aaliyah, Tupac, Beyoncé and Destiny\\'s Child. Other musical influences and idols include Celine Dion, Grace Jones, Lil\\' Kim, Alicia Keys, Prince, Fefe Dobson, and Brandy. Rihanna takes influence from the different types of music she discovered when she came to America and revealed that rock music was one of the first genres she fell in love with. She commented, \"as I grow older, I want to know more about music. I want to discover more types of music\". She cited Brandy\\'s fourth studio album, Afrodisiac (2004), as her main inspiration for her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007). In her early career, her music contained strong influences of Caribbean music, including reggae and dancehall. The music video of the song \"Rude Boy\" featured images inspired by her Caribbean roots.\\n\\nVideos and stage\\nRihanna has worked with music video director Anthony Mandler on more than a dozen music videos, the first being \"Unfaithful\" (2006). \"We\\'ve done 16 videos together; they\\'re not all tough, [...] Yeah, I mean, I\\'m known for the \\'Disturbia\\'s and the \\'Russian Roulette\\'s and things like that, but \\'Only Girl (In the World)\\' is certainly an ethereal kind of empowering, beauty-filled video,\" Mandler said. Jocelyn Vena of MTV wrote, \"Rihanna, like Madonna, also has a tendency to make truly thought-provoking music videos that fit the songs they represent. Smattered in between glitzier, more glamorous clips, Madge and Ri want us to think about bigger issues\". Jon Bream of the Star Tribune commented \"[i]n the tradition of Madonna and Janet Jackson, Rihanna has become the video vixen of the \\'00s ... Rihanna has perfected the pout, the long-legged strut, and trend-setting hairdos that keep women and men alike checking her out on YouTube.\" George Epaminondas of InStyle considers Rihanna\\'s music videos to be \"cinematic\" due to her \"blend of lush island rhythms and swinging pop and ... mischievous sensuality.\"\\n\\nMany of her music videos were shot as short films exploring issues such as love triangles, abuse and substance abuse romance, including \"We Found Love\" and \"Man Down\". Her music video for \"Umbrella\" shows Rihanna\\'s transition into adulthood and her newly adopted image. The \"dark, creepy\" scenes of \"Disturbia\" have been compared to Michael Jackson\\'s Thriller. The video for \"Russian Roulette\" features Rihanna in a padded room playing a game of russian roulette with her partner. A scene of Rihanna being approached by a speeding car at night was compared to the altercation with Chris Brown.\\nIn 2011, Rihanna released three controversial music videos about sadomasochism, rape and domestic violence. \"Man Down\", which features Rihanna shooting a man in a train station, was criticized by the Parents Television Council. \"We Found Love\", which shows Rihanna and her love interest in a drug-filled unhealthy relationship, sparked criticism from the Rape Crisis Centre for its message. Charne Graham of the Houston Press defended her, asking, \"Why should Rihanna\\'s music videos get everyone riled up when others\\' equally sexual and controversial videos are in rotation? [...] she just like[s] to make music videos that give us something to talk about.\" Rihanna was the first woman to pass 2 billion cumulative views on the music video website Vevo.\\nDenis Armstrong of Canadian Online Explorer commented on her performance at the Ottawa Bluesfest, saying \"her show was a Disney-esque choreographed fantasy of non-stop hip-swiveling, sassy attitude and personal endearments and a string of funky, sugar-free hits.\" Her performance of \"Disturbia\" at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards was ranked tenth best on the MTV Video Music Awards, according to a Billboard poll. Her revealing leather costumes during her Good Girl Gone Bad Tour were highly criticized by the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, who recommended that her concert tour should be banned. Whilst commenting on her third album\\'s accompanying tour, The Times compared Rihanna\\'s stage wardrobe styling to that of Janet Jackson and called her \"a vision of Ann Summers couture in thigh-high boots and a few scraps of black PVC.\" In the October 2011 issue of British Vogue, Rihanna said her performance outfits and appearances are all an act; \"[t]hat\\'s not me. That\\'s a part I play. You know, like it\\'s a piece of art, with all these toys and textures to play with\".\\n\\nPublic image\\nKnown for her style and image, the media have constantly followed the evolution of Rihanna\\'s music and fashion sense. In 2009, New York magazine described Rihanna\\'s early look as that of \"a cookie-cutter teen queen\", noting she has the ability \"to shift looks dramatically and with such ease\". Around the time of the release of her second studio album, A Girl like Me (2006), many critics felt that Rihanna\\'s style, sound and musical material were too similar to those of Beyoncé. In an interview with Look magazine, Rihanna spoke about comparisons to Beyoncé: \"Beyoncé is a great artist and I feel honored to be mentioned in the same sentence, but we\\'re different performers with different styles\". She revealed during Oprah\\'s Next Chapter that Def Jam\\'s pop-princess blueprint made her feel claustrophobic during her early years with the label. According to Rihanna, \"I felt like they were giving me a blueprint. [...] They had a brand, they had an idea of what they wanted me to be without figuring out who I was.\" With the release of her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), Rihanna dismissed her innocent image for an edgier look with a new hairstyle, which was inspired by Charlize Theron\\'s bob cut in the science fiction thriller Æon Flux (2005). She followed the likes of recording artists Janet Jackson and Christina Aguilera who also shed their innocent image for an edgier look and sound.\\nNico Amarca of Highsnobiety magazine wrote, \"over the course of her now 10-year career, [Rihanna] has undergone one of the most significant aesthetic metamorphoses the world has ever seen\". Her image and fashion has changed several times with different hairstyles since the release of her third album. She commented that as a child she \"used to watch her [mother] get dressed\" and that her love and admiration for fashion started with her mother. When putting together her own wardrobe she stated, \"It\\'s become more about taking a risk ... I always look for the most interesting silhouette or something that\\'s a little off.\" Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian wrote that \"Rihanna\\'s wardrobe is the most talked-about, influential and dissected in pop right now\" and that whatever she wears \"is immediately reproduced on the high street, because it sells\". Country singer Miranda Lambert admires Rihanna\\'s fashion and style stating, \"I don\\'t necessarily get inspired by the whole no-bra thing, but I love that you never know what she\\'s going to wear. It always keeps you guessing, which makes her sassy and interesting.\"\\nIn an interview with Alexa Chung during Vogue Festival 2015, Balmain designer Olivier Rousteing praised Rihanna by stylistically comparing her to some of the biggest fashion icons in music history, such as Madonna, David Bowie, Michael Jackson, and Prince. Commenting on the cultural expectation for pop stars to be role models, Rihanna said \"[being a role model] became more of my job than I wanted it to be. But no, I just want to make music. That\\'s it.\" In a May 2013 interview with MTV, The Vagina Monologues writer and feminist Eve Ensler said, \"I\\'m a huge Rihanna fan, I think she has a kind of agency over her sexuality and she\\'s open about her sexuality, she has enormous grace and she\\'s immensely talented.\"\\nDescribed as one of the sexiest women of her generation, she revealed that being a sex symbol is not a priority and that \"it\\'s definitely flattering, but also uncomfortable.\" Her appearance has landed her on the cover of magazines such as Maxim, FHM, Rolling Stone, and in December 2012, Rihanna became the first woman to be featured on the cover of GQ magazine\\'s \"Men of the Year\" issue.\\nRihanna made her first appearance at the Met Gala in 2007. She has made eight appearances in the years since; notably in 2015, for China: Through the Looking Glass, her Guo Pei-designed yellow dress garnered the most attention of the event, accruing a billion impressions on social media. The dress, which had taken two years to make before Rihanna came across it, became the subject of a documentary by Pietra Brettkelly, entitled Yellow Is Forbidden.\\nShe co-chaired the 2018 Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination themed event, wearing Maison Margiela.\\nAs of 2021, Rihanna is the world\\'s wealthiest female musician with an estimated net worth of $1.7 billion. She was also listed among Forbes\\' Top 100 Most Powerful Women of 2019. In 2020, she debuted on the Sunday Times Rich List, claiming third place on the list of Britain\\'s richest musicians.\\n\\nLegacy\\nRihanna is regarded by the media as a pop and fashion icon, particularly since her third studio album Good Girl Gone Bad (2007). Nick Levine of Digital Spy described Good Girl Gone Bad as \"the closest thing to a Thriller that 2007/08 is likely to produce\". According to Rolling Stone, her single \"Umbrella\" and her eighth album Anti are regarded as among the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, respectively. Her single \"Work\" has been credited by a Billboard editor for bringing the dancehall genre to the forefront of mainstream American music. Music critic Jayson Greene of Pitchfork described Rihanna as the most influential singer of the past decade, writing:\"Rihanna Voice has become an industry-wide idea, a creative property like the Korg synth or LinnDrum [...] We crave the thrill that you can only get when a dozen or so good ideas manifest themselves in a single voice. For the past 10 years, that voice has more or less been Rihanna\\'s. Now that she\\'s gleefully shredding it apart, she\\'ll probably generate a whole new comet trail of Rihannabes. Inevitably, none of them will carry the charge, the glassy cool and subterranean heat, of the real thing.\"\\n\\nIn August 2018, Billboard ranked Rihanna as the tenth biggest Hot 100 artist of all time, as well as the fifth biggest female act of all time. Billboard also ranked Rihanna the top Hot 100 artist of the 2010s decade.

Time magazine included Rihanna on its 100 Most Influential People in the World issue in 2012 and 2018, with Stella McCartney writing: \"She\\'s one of the coolest, hottest, most talented, most liked, most listened to, most followed, most impressive artists at work today, but she does it in her own stride. She works hard, very hard. She gives to her fans, friends and foundation not just herself but her energy and spirit.\" Rihanna was ranked one of the best dressed women in 2018, by luxury fashion retailer Net-a-Porter. On June 2, 2014, Rihanna was presented with the Fashion Icon lifetime achievement award from Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA), a special prize reserved for \"an individual whose style has made a significant impact on popular culture on an international stage\". \\nRihanna has an honorary title of Ambassador for Culture and Youth in Barbados.

According to Rolling Stone, Reb\\'l Fleur was a financial success and was expected to gross US$80 million at retail by the end of 2011.\\nRihanna\\'s second fragrance, Rebelle, was released in February 2012.

In January 2019, Rihanna filed a lawsuit against her father, Ronald Fenty, over the use of the Fenty name for commercial purposes. The lawsuit alleges Rihanna\\'s cosmetics brand, Fenty Beauty, was damaged commercially by her father\\'s company, Fenty Entertainment, through misrepresentation of his company being affiliated with her.

Time magazine named Fenty Beauty as one of \"The 25 Best Inventions of 2017\", highlighting the breadth of its range. In what has been dubbed the \"Fenty Effect\", the brand revolutionized the way other cosmetic brands approached diversity in marketing and product formulation: \"Suddenly beauty houses – niche, establishment and those in between – began extending their shade ranges to accommodate a wider variety of skin tones. Forty shades became the new standard.\"\\n\\nSavage X Fenty\\nIn 2018, Rihanna launched a lingerie brand named Savage X Fenty. The line was born from Rihanna\\'s vision creating an inclusive brand. Products come in a variety of shades to match all skin tones and a range of sizes. She showcased the brand at the New York Fashion Week in September 2018. The brand has been positively reviewed by the public for including plus size models in their promotion, though some fans argued there were not enough plus sizes.\\nIn September 2019, Rihanna promoted the brand in a show again during the New York Fashion Week held at the Barclays Center with modeling appearances from models Alex Wek, Bella Hadid, Cara Delevingne, actress Laverne Cox, and musicians Normani and 21 Savage.

              " 'Total Request Live (known commonly as TRL) is an American television program broadcast on MTV that premiered on September 14, 1998. The early version of TRL featured popular music videos played during its countdown and was also used as a promotion tool by musicians, actors, and other celebrities to promote their newest works to target the show\\'s teen demographic.\\nDuring the original run of the program, TRL played the ten most requested music videos of the day, as voted on by viewers via phone or online. The show generally aired Monday through Thursday for one hour, though the scheduling and length of the show fluctuated over the years. Although TRL was billed as a live show, many episodes were prerecorded. Due to declining ratings, and the larger decline of music-based television in favor of online services, MTV announced the cancellation of TRL on September 15, 2008. The special three-hour finale episode, Total Finale Live, aired on November 16, 2008.\\nLess than a decade later, TRL was revived on October 2, 2017. In 2019, the show aired Saturday mornings at 10:00 am ET as TRL Top 10. The show was then rebranded to Fresh Out Live.\\n\\nHistory\\nOrigin\\nTotal Request Live originated from several pre-existing programs on MTV. Various viewer request shows, such as Dial MTV and MTV\\'s Most Wanted, had aired on the network since 1986. In 1997 and 1998, MTV launched two new shows that became the predecessors of TRL: MTV Live, which was hosted by Toby Amies, Carson Daly, and Ananda Lewis and featured live performances and interviews from musical artists, and Total Request, a viewer request show hosted by Daly.\\n\\nTotal Request was more subdued than MTV Live, as Daly introduced music videos from an empty, dimly lit set. As the show progressed and gained more momentum, it was added to the daytime programming during MTV\\'s Summer Share in Seaside Heights, New Jersey. The show proved to be one of the most watched and most interactive in MTV history, demonstrating that it had potential to become an even larger success.\\n\\nOriginal run (1998–2008)\\nCarson Daly era\\nIn September 1998, MTV producers merged the real-time aspect of MTV Live with the fan-controlled countdown aspect of Total Request into Total Request Live. The program made its debut from MTV Studios on September 14. The show then grew to become MTV\\'s unofficial flagship program.\\nThe original host of TRL, Carson Daly, brought popularity to the show. The abbreviation TRL was adopted as the official title of the show in February 1999, after Daly and Dave Holmes began using it on air regularly. In the years following, the program was rarely referred to by its original title. The show began successfully, receiving hundreds of votes for popular artists such as Hanson, Aaliyah, Blaque, TLC, Eminem, Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, Korn, Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, Janet Jackson, *NSYNC, and Backstreet Boys.\\nTRL spent its first year developing a cult-type following. In late 1999, a live studio audience was added. By early 2000, the show reached its peak, becoming a very recognizable pop culture icon in its first two years of existence. A weekend edition of the show known as TRL Weekend, with a countdown of the week\\'s top 10 videos, aired for a short time in 2000.\\nIn 2000, MTV gradually began introducing new VJs on TRL. After winning a viewer contest to interview celebrities at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Hilarie Burton was hired as a full-time VJ. Quddus Philippe began hosting duties in May 2001 as part of MTV\\'s Summer in the Keys. The following year, both Damien Fahey and La La Vasquez began hosting duties. These VJs often co-hosted with Daly or substituted in his absence.\\nIn July 2001, MTV sponsored the Total Request Live Tour, which played over 30 dates in North America and featured acts like Destiny\\'s Child, 3LW, Jessica Simpson, Eve, and Nelly.\\nOn October 23, 2002, TRL celebrated its 1,000th episode. The number-one video on that day was \"Dirrty\" by Christina Aguilera. Also throughout 2002, original host Daly was gradually seen less often, as he had begun his own late-night talk show Last Call with Carson Daly on NBC. The show had near-daily segments from MTV News correspondents reporting on the latest in national or entertainment and music news from inside the studio.\\n\\nPost-Carson Daly era\\nIn 2003, the next generation of TRL was ushered in as Carson Daly officially stepped down as host to focus on his own talk show, which premiered a year earlier on NBC. Following Daly\\'s departure, Damien Fahey, Hilarie Burton, Quddus, and La La Vasquez rotated as hosts. Later additions to the hosting roster included Vanessa Minnillo in 2003, Susie Castillo in 2005, Stephen Colletti in 2006, and Lyndsey Rodrigues in 2007.\\nSome changes were made to TRL\\'s voting process in 2005. The show previously allowed anyone to vote online several times, but as part of these changes, only registered members of MTV.com could vote online. Additionally, a limit of one vote per day was added. Then, on July 10, 2006, MTV announced that votes would not be taken by phone, ending the use of the \"DIAL MTV\" phone number, which had been in use for voting on MTV since the premiere of the countdown show Dial MTV in the mid-1980s.\\n\\nIn September 2006, TRL reached its eighth anniversary and, at that point, the show was the longest-running live program that MTV had ever produced. Around this time, it began airing four days a week (Monday through Thursday), instead of all five weekdays. On November 2, 2006, the show introduced what was billed as the first-ever hip hop public service announcement on global warming. The three-minute piece, titled \"Trees\", warned about deforestation and the dangers of global warming. The video corresponded with MTV\\'s social campaign, Break the Addiction, as part of think MTV.\\nOn May 22, 2007, TRL celebrated its 2000th episode, showing highlights from the past 2000 episodes, and a special countdown of ten of the most successful videos to ever appear on the show. Justin Timberlake\\'s \"Cry Me a River\" topped the special countdown.\\nBy 2008, the only remaining hosts of TRL were Fahey and Rodrigues. Burton left TRL in 2004 after joining the cast of The WB/CW\\'s One Tree Hill. Quddus departed in 2006 and became host of TV One Access. Minnillo left in 2007 and resumed an acting career.\\n\\nFirst cancellation\\nIn 2007, rumors began circulating that the ratings-challenged music video countdown show was to be cancelled. In early 2007, an average of 373,000 viewers regularly watched the program. New York Daily News were one of the first to publish this rumor. In February 2007, MTV said the rumor was unfounded and claimed TRL would continue to air for the foreseeable future. The producers of TRL experimented with web-based viewer interaction throughout the 2006–2007 season, showing viral videos and allowing viewers to send feedback on a video via internet forums and webcams, along with a heavy emphasis on MTV\\'s since discontinued Overdrive video portal. However, MTV still secretly planned to cancel the show and replace one with even more emphasis on viewer interaction, named YouRL (a homophone of URL.) Consequently, in July 2007, it was reported that YouRL was not received well by test audiences and the concept was abandoned. Total Request Live proceeded with a new season as usual on September 4, marking the tenth season of the show.\\n\\nOn September 15, 2008, it was announced that TRL would end. The final regular weekday episode aired on November 13, 2008, with guest Seth Green and The All-American Rejects.  The Rejects spent the entire episode assisting in the tear down of the set which was a theme for the episode.  At the end of the episode, Rodrigues and Fahey cooperatively added the last step in the demolition process by shutting down all the lights.  Preceding this was a montage of cast and crew members saying their goodbyes by waving to the camera. Total Finale Live, a three-hour special marking the end of the show, aired on November 16, 2008. Several artists made appearances, including Ludacris, Snoop Dogg, Nelly, Beyoncé, 50 Cent, Fall Out Boy, Backstreet Boys, Justin Timberlake, Kid Rock, JC Chasez, Christina Aguilera, Travis Barker, Taylor Swift, Hilary Duff, Eminem, and Korn\\'s Jonathan Davis. Former host Carson Daly described the media atmosphere after his departure from TRL in an interview with TV Guide: \"MySpace was sold. Social networking took off. Technology went crazy. The whole tectonic shift of mass media. There were a lot of reasons why TRL became kind of a different show after I left. I don\\'t necessarily think it had anything to with me leaving as much as it had to do with the changing landscape.\" The last music video to be played on TRL (during the final episode) was \"...Baby One More Time\" by Britney Spears, as the video that made number one on the countdown of the most iconic videos of all time.\\n\\nFinal top 10\\nTRL chose the top ten most iconic videos and aired them as their final countdown.\\n\\nRevivals (2014–2016)\\nOn June 25, 2014, MTV announced that they would bring back Total Request Live for a one-off special edition on July 2, presented by MTV personality Sway with recording artist Ariana Grande, who performed her single \"Problem\" and premiered her song \"Break Free\", as well as having her hip hop knowledge tested in a \"Hip Hop Mix Up\" game. The special was titled Total Ariana Live and was broadcast from MTV\\'s Times Square studio in front of a live audience. Grande called it \"a huge honor\" to bring back TRL. The episode drew an average of 456,000 viewers.\\nOn September 27, 2016, as part of MTV\\'s Elect This campaign, the network revived the program for a one-hour live special called Total Registration Live. It was simulcast on MTV\\'s website, app, Facebook and YouTube pages, and ElectThis.com. It was hosted by Nessa and featured performances by Ty Dolla $ign from his politically motivated mixtape Campaign. Kendall Jenner appeared in Times Square on behalf of Rock the Vote, and Ana Marie Cox and Jamil Smith from MTV News appeared on-air for segments. There were other appearances by Joss Whedon, Camila Cabello, Vic Mensa, Natalia Dyer, and Mack Wilds. Stories of millennials who have been activists were spotlighted.\\n\\nMTV Classic\\nFollowing the launch of MTV Classic on August 1, 2016, music video blocks have consistently aired on the network under the name Total Request Playlist. However, this is merely an automated playlist of pop, rap/hip-hop, R&B, and rock videos from the late 1990s to the 2000s.\\n\\nReturn (2017–2019)\\nOn July 30, 2017, MTV announced that the network would revive TRL. In addition to the hosts, Liza Koshy, The Dolan Twins, Eva Gutowski, Gabbie Hanna and Gigi Gorgeous and Jaymes Skendarian were correspondents.\\nSince January 22, 2018, TRL has been shortened from a full hour to only a half-hour per day. The program was on hiatus until April 23, 2018. In February 2018, a half-hour late-night edition of TRL, Total Request LateNight was launched. The show aired Monday and Tuesday at 11 PM and was often an after-show for a preceding program. MTV announced plans to expand the show to three nights in the summer and four nights by the end of the year, but this never materialized. On April 23, 2018, MTV launched a pre-recorded, hour-long daily morning edition of TRL titled Total Request AM. The show aired at 8 AM and was hosted by Sway. Vinny from Jersey Shore was brought on as host for the first week and the first guests were boy band PrettyMuch. The program featured the return of a top ten countdown focusing on a specific playlist (Monday Motivation being the first countdown).\\n2019 saw another retooling and name change to TRL Top 10, which featured hosts Sway, Kevan Kenney and Jamila Mustafa. An offshoot of the program, Fresh Out Live, airs every Friday on MTV.\\n\\nImpact\\nTRL became \"appointment after-school TV, its studio at 1515 Broadway a pop-culture fishbowl where rabid teens could catch a glimpse of their favorite stars.\" Debuting before social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, the show is considered one \"of the first truly interactive television shows, utilizing the synergy of the internet and television to countdown the top music videos of the day.\" Among the interactive features of TRL was the video shoutout, a 15-second video clip where fans could \"appear, screen-within-screen, during the airing of a music video\" screaming about their love for an artist or band. Because TRL was initially filmed in an age before social media, the show was seen as \"the last pure view of...big celebrities. You were getting unadulterated ego.\" The show had a number of notably unscripted moments happen in studio, such as band members streaking or celebrities showing up unannounced. Taylor Hanson of Hanson, a frequent guest on TRL, said \"Before you could see what an artist had for breakfast from Twitter, TRL was the place you were going to hear about it.\"\\nTRL not only became \"destination TV\" for young people to get news on their favorite stars and on pop culture, but also a place for viewers to stay updated with major world events as MTV News reporters would make regular appearances announcing news headlines. As MTV News correspondent SuChin Pak said, \"For young people, TRL was not only where you got to see your rock idols and pop stars, but where you connected with the major events happening around the world, outside the small town you were living in.\"\\nThe show was likened to the millennial generation\\'s version of American Bandstand or Soul Train, averaging 853,000 viewers in 1999 according to Nielsen. TRL is widely viewed as the show that launched the careers of many artists from the late 1990s and early 2000s. MTV News correspondent John Norris said, \"It\\'s an interesting debate whether NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, Britney [Spears], Christina [Aguilera], Jessica [Simpson] and Good Charlotte would have had the careers they had without TRL.\" Writing for Spin, Peter Gaston opined that TRL \"helped keep the major labels afloat by boosting pop artists sales numbers on the Billboard charts.\" TRL became a \"must-stop on every celebrity\\'s promotional itinerary.\" Musicians themselves including Eminem and Britney Spears would sometimes fill in for the hosts. The show was also the site of in-studio performances by big artists promoting album releases.\\n\\nBoy bands\\nEven though late 1990s boy bands like Backstreet Boys and NSYNC released albums before TRL began in the fall of 1998, both groups only reached their commercial peaks after their videos were seen on TRL. In 1999, the Backstreet Boys\\' second LP, Millennium, achieved the highest first week sales ever from an LP at the time.\\nIn 2000, when NSYNC released their second LP No Strings Attached, they topped the Backstreet Boys\\' first week sales and set a record for first-week album sales that would last for 15 years until Adele\\'s 25 surpassed the record in 2015. Fans numbering in the thousands stood outside TRL\\'s studio to see NSYNC or Backstreet Boys appear as guests, resulting in the closure of Times Square. Throughout most of 1998, 1999, and 2000, videos by the Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC would claim the top position on the countdown. Other boy bands of the era who achieved number one videos or received heavy rotation on the show included 98 Degrees, O-Town, B2K, soulDecision, and LFO.\\n\\nPop princesses\\nPop singers like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Mandy Moore and Jessica Simpson all made their music debuts on TRL as well. Spears, Aguilera, and Simpson would often appear as guests and their music videos would receive regular airplay. Simpson\\'s video \"Irresistible\" reached number two on the countdown in 2001. Shakira made her English-language pop debut with \"Whenever, Wherever\", and saw regular number one spot status with the songs \"Objection (Tango)\", \"La Tortura\" (the first only Spanish-speaking song to reach number one on the countdown), and \"Hips Don\\'t Lie\". Mandy Moore saw success on the show with her debut single\\'s \"Candy\" in 1999 and \"I Wanna Be with You\", but did not score her first number-one video until her 2002 single \"Crush\".\\nJessica Simpson\\'s younger sister Ashlee Simpson is another pop singer that has had success on TRL. Ashlee would go on to score two videos in the number one spot with \"Boyfriend\" and \"Invisible.\" The artist with the most retired videos is Britney Spears with 13 videos retired, an honorary retired video (\"I\\'m a Slave 4 U\"), and three videos retired number one. A \"pop princess\" streak occurred in March 2007, where the number one and number two spots were women for every show. There was no other month in the history of TRL where every show had a woman at the top spot.\\n\\nRock bands\\nAlthough best known for featuring pop acts, TRL regularly featured videos and performances from rock bands in genres such as nu metal, pop punk and emo pop. The nu metal/rap metal bands Korn and Limp Bizkit were particularly popular on the program in the late 1990s, and often shared airtime with Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys. In later years, Green Day, Blink-182, My Chemical Romance, Linkin Park, Fall Out Boy and Sum 41 also were successful on the TRL chart.\\n\\nDisney stars\\nHilary Duff was the first Disney Star in heavy rotation on MTV, She premiered \"So Yesterday\", which peaked at number one days later, and continue to top the countdown with the videos for \"Our Lips Are Sealed\", \"Fly\", \"Wake Up\", \"Beat of My Heart\" and\"With Love\" and her popularity was a determining factor for another Disney stars on TRL. Vanessa Hudgens premiered \"Come Back to Me\", which peaked at number three, and \"Say OK\", which only went to number ten. The Jonas Brothers premiered their songs \"Hold On\" and \"SOS\" on the show; \"SOS\" made it on the countdown peaking at number six. \"When You Look Me in the Eyes\" was on the charts for several weeks before peaking at number one, after fans crushed and flooded the TRL site by requesting the video hundreds of times on March 19, 2008. \"Burnin\\' Up\" has also made it to the number-one spot on TRL. Ashley Tisdale premiered \"He Said She Said\" on TRL and it reached the number-one spot for 16 days and was retired at 40 days in the countdown, becoming the most successful song for a Disney recording artist in the show. Aly & AJ\\'s videos for \"Rush\", \"Chemicals React\" and \"Potential Breakup Song\" have all been on the countdown with \"Rush\" peaking at number two and \"Chemicals React\" peaking at number four, and \"Potential Breakup Song\" peaking at number five. Miley Cyrus\\'s \"7 Things\" premiered on TRL and reached number four on the show.\\n\\nVideo game\\nA PC video game called MTV Total Request Live Trivia was developed by Hypnotix and published by Take-Two Interactive, with a release on August 14, 2001. GameRankings rated it at 53.89% acclaim, with a 48/100 grade from Metacritic.\\n\\nInternational versions\\nPast programs\\nThe first version of TRL outside the US was in Italy. Started on MTV Italy on 2 November 1999, it was hosted by Marco Maccarini and Giorgia Surina, followed by Federico Russo and Carolina Di Domenico. Since the 2005–06 season, Surina returned to TRL with a new co-host, Alessandro Cattelan. After the 2005–06 season, the show was hosted only by Cattelan. For the 2007–08 season, the show was hosted for the first moment by Cattelan and Elena Santarelli, and for the summer, the male host was replaced by Carlo Pastore. Later Pastore was still the main host, but the female host changed to Elisabetta Canalis. Throughout its eight seasons, TRL was broadcast from Milan, Rome, Venice, Naples, Genoa and Turin. TRL Italy is the longest-running show on MTV Italy: on 23 December 2004, a special two-hour event, \"TRL #1000\", was aired to celebrate the programme\\'s 1000th episode. From 2006 to 2012, there was also an award programme called TRL Awards where viewers chose the artist of the year via web or mobile. In the summer of 2007, a special weekly show called TRL Extra Live aired, featuring Italian singers performing a mini-concert. The final version of the programme was hosted by Brenda Lodigiani, Alessandro Arcodia, Wintana Rezene and Andrea Cadioli under the name TRL on the Road and ended on 24 September 2010.\\n\\nMTV România launched the Romanian version of TRL from an Orange concept store on Calea Victoriei (a major commercial avenue in the centre of Bucharest) on 23 January 2006. The show aired two times a week on Tuesday and Wednesday. The graphics were similar to that of the Italian version. The show was cancelled in 2009.\\nThe British version, known as TRL UK, was hosted by Dave Berry, Alex Zane, Jo Good, and Maxine Akhtar. It was broadcast live from MTV Networks Europe Studios in Camden, London before moving to Leicester Square in London from second series. Following the second series\\' broadcast from Leicester Square, the top ten countdown was removed from the show. The second series finished at the end of 2005 and the show never returned to air.\\nThe Australian version of TRL began as a weekend show, but then began airing live Monday through Friday. It was hosted by Maz Compton, Lyndsey Rodrigues, Nathan Sapsford, and Jason Robert Dundas. In early 2006, it returned to airing only on Friday evenings. The show was cancelled at the end of 2006 and was replaced by \"The Lair\". A revival of TRL returned in 2019. It is hosted by Ash London, Angus O\\'Loughlin, Flex Mami, and Lisa Hamilton.\\nAfter a Polish version of TRL was unsuccessful, MTV Poland decided to launch a new chart show based on TRL\\'s structure titled RMF MAXXX Hits, which aired from Monday to Saturday at 2 pm.\\nMTV France launched the French version (Ton Request Live) of the US show on 24 January 2007. The format was different from the original concept: there was no video countdown and each episode included a film\\'s mini-documentaries entitled \"TRL en Movies\". The show closed after only a single episode on 25 January 2007.\\nThe German version of TRL was very successful throughout Europe (after Italy), and it was known as Total Request Live Germany. TRL Germany had the highest television ratings of all the TRL versions in Europe. The show was hosted by Joko Winterscheidt and Mirjam Weichselbraun or Patrice Bouédibéla from Tuesday to Friday from 4:30 to 5:30 pm, and it was divided in four versions: Urban TRL (hip-hop music), Rock TRL (rock music), regular TRL (various genres), and TRL XXL (special live guest). It was replaced with MTV Home in Summer 2009.\\n\\nSimilar programs\\nIn Latin America, a version of TRL called Los 10+ Pedidos (The 10 Most Requested) airs daily. The show is hosted by \"Gabo\" and \"Macarena\".\\nMTV Tr3s, a US channel targeted to bilingual Latino people, premiered Mi TRL in September 2006. The show carried the same format and graphics as the English-language version of TRL. Mi TRL was initially anchored by Carlos Santos and Susie Castillo, with Santos later being replaced by Denise Ramerez. MTV News segments on the show are delivered from Los Angeles by correspondent Liz Hernandez. The show was cancelled along with TRL in November 2008.\\nViacom\\'s sister channel BET featured its own urban-oriented countdown, 106 & Park, and the two shows frequently competed with one another for guests, though by the end of the run of TRL, both shows aired with some space between them, allowing guests to appear on both shows on the same day.\\nTeenNick featured a kid-friendly rendition of TRL called TeenNick Top 10.\\n\\nSee also\\nTRL\\'s Number Ones\\n\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nJackman, Ian (2000).

              " 'Céline Marie Claudette Dion  ( say-LEEN dee-ON; born 30 March 1968) is a Canadian singer. Referred to as the \"Queen of Power Ballads\", she is noted for her powerful and technically skilled vocals. Her music has incorporated genres such as pop, rock, R&B, gospel, and classical music. Her recordings have been mainly in English and French, although she has also sung in several other languages.\\nBorn into a large family in Charlemagne, Quebec, Dion was discovered by her future manager and husband, René Angélil, and emerged as a teen star in her home country with a series of French-language albums during the 1980s. She gained international recognition by winning the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest, where she represented Switzerland with \"Ne partez pas sans moi\". Her debut English-language album, Unison (1990), established her as a viable pop artist primarily in North America and several English-speaking markets, while The Colour of My Love (1993) gave her global superstardom. Dion continued her success throughout the 1990s with several of the bestselling albums in history, such as Falling into You (1996) and Let\\'s Talk About Love (1997), which were certified diamond in the US with more than 30 million sales worldwide each. She also released a series of international number-one hits, including \"The Power of Love\", \"Think Twice\", \"To Love You More\", \"Because You Loved Me\", \"It\\'s All Coming Back to Me Now\", \"I\\'m Your Angel\", \"That\\'s the Way It Is\", \"I\\'m Alive\" and \"My Heart Will Go On\", the theme for the 1997 film Titanic, which solidified her popularity.\\nDion continued releasing French-language albums between each English record; D\\'eux (1995) became the best-selling French-language album of all time, while S\\'il suffisait d\\'aimer (1998), Sans attendre (2012), and Encore un soir (2016), were all certified diamond in France. During the 2000s, she built her reputation as a successful live performer with A New Day... on the Las Vegas Strip (2003–07), the highest-grossing concert residency of all time, and the Taking Chances World Tour (2008–09), one of the highest-grossing concert tours of the 2000s. In 2009, she was named by the Los Angeles Times as the top-earning artist of the decade, with combined album sales and concert revenue exceeding $747 million. In 2022, Dion canceled a tour due to her diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome, a rare neurological disease.\\nWith 200 million records sold worldwide, Dion is the best-selling Canadian recording artist, the best-selling French-language artist, and one of the best-selling musical artists of all time. She is the sixth most successful female artist in the history of US Billboard 200 and received recognition from the IFPI for selling over 50 million albums in Europe. Seven of her albums have sold at least 10 million copies worldwide, the second most among women in history. She was ranked as the fourth most outstanding pop vocalist by Cover Magazine and the ninth greatest voice in music by MTV. One of the highest-grossing touring artists in history, she is the second woman to accumulate US$1 billion in concert revenue. According to Forbes, Dion was the world\\'s highest-paid female musician in 1997, 1998, 2004, and 2006. Dion has also received two honorary doctorates in music degree from Berklee College of Music and Université Laval.\\n\\nLife and career\\n1968–1989: Early life and career beginnings\\nDion was born in Charlemagne, Quebec, 24 kilometres (15 mi) northeast of Montreal, the youngest of 14 children of Thérèse (née Tanguay, 1927–2020), a homemaker, and Adhémar Dion (1923–2003), a butcher, both of French descent. She was raised a Roman Catholic in a poor but, by her own account, happy home in Charlemagne. Music had always been a major part of the Dion family, and she was named after the song \"Céline\", which French singer Hugues Aufray had recorded two years before her birth. On 13 August 1973, she made her first public appearance at her brother Michel\\'s wedding, where she performed Christine Charbonneau\\'s song \"Du fil, des aiguilles et du coton\". She continued to perform with her siblings in her parents\\' small piano bar called Le Vieux Baril, \"The Old Barrel\".\\nShe suffered a number of accidents as a young child, including an incident at five years old when she was struck by a car as her father and brother Clément looked on. She was hospitalized briefly with a concussion. From an early age, she had dreamed of being a performer. In a 1994 interview with People, she recalled, \"I missed my family and my home, but I don\\'t regret having lost my adolescence. I had one dream: I wanted to be a singer.\" As a child in Quebec, Dion participated in Girl Guide programs as a member of Girl Guides of Canada.\\nAt age 12, she collaborated with her mother and her brother Jacques to write and compose her first song, \"Ce n\\'était qu\\'un rêve\", whose title translates as \"It Was Only a Dream\" or \"Nothing But A Dream\". Michel sent the recording to music manager René Angélil, whose name he discovered on the back of a Ginette Reno album. Angélil was moved to tears by Dion\\'s voice and decided to make her a star. In 1981, he mortgaged his home to fund her first record, La voix du bon Dieu, which later became a local No. 1 hit and made her an instant star in Quebec. Her popularity spread to other parts of the world when she competed in the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival in Tokyo and won the musician\\'s award for \"Top Performer\" as well as the gold medal for \"Best Song\" with \"Tellement j\\'ai d\\'amour pour toi\".\\nBy 1983, in addition to becoming the first Canadian artist to receive a gold record in France for the single \"D\\'amour ou d\\'amitié\" (\"Of Love or of Friendship\"), Dion had also won several Félix Awards, including \"Best Female performer\" and \"Discovery of the Year\". Further success came when she represented Switzerland in the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest with the song \"Ne partez pas sans moi\" and won the contest by a close margin in Dublin. At age 18, after seeing a Michael Jackson performance, Dion told Angélil she wanted to be a star like Jackson. Though confident in her talent, Angélil realized her image needed to be changed for her to be marketed worldwide. She withdrew from the spotlight for a number of months, during which she underwent dental surgery to improve her appearance, and was sent to the École Berlitz in 1989 to improve her English. In 1989, during a concert on the Incognito tournée, she injured her voice. She consulted the otorhinolaryngologist William Gould, who gave her an ultimatum: have immediate surgery on her vocal cords or do not utilize them at all for three weeks. Dion chose the latter and underwent vocal training with William Riley.\\n\\n1990–1992: Unison, Dion chante Plamondon, and Celine Dion\\nTwo years after she learned English, Dion made her debut into the Anglophone market with Unison (1990), the lead single having originally been recorded by English singer Junior in 1983 and later Laura Branigan. She incorporated the help of producers including Vito Luprano and David Foster. The album was largely influenced by 1980s soft rock music and quickly found a niche within the adult contemporary radio format. Unison also hit the right notes with critics: Jim Farber of Entertainment Weekly wrote her vocals were \"tastefully unadorned\", and she never attempted to \"bring off styles that are beyond her\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared it \"a fine, sophisticated American debut\". Singles from the album included \"(If There Was) Any Other Way\", \"The Last to Know\", \"Unison\", and \"Where Does My Heart Beat Now\", a mid-tempo soft-rock ballad made prominent use of the electric guitar. The latter became her first top-ten hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number four. In 1991, Dion was a featured soloist on \"Voices That Care\", a tribute to American troops fighting in Operation Desert Storm.\\nHer real international breakthrough came when she duetted with Peabo Bryson on the title track to Disney\\'s animated film Beauty and the Beast (1991). It became her first top-ten hit in the UK and her second top-ten hit in the United States. The song earned its songwriters an Academy Award for Best Song and gave Dion her first Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. \"Beauty and the Beast\" served as the lead single from her 1992 self-titled album, which, like her debut, had a strong pop rock influence combined with elements of soul and classical music. Owing to the success of the lead-off single and her collaborations with David Foster and Diane Warren, the album was even more well-received commercially than Unison; it was certified diamond in Canada and double platinum in the U.S. The album\\'s second single \"If You Asked Me To\" (a cover of Patti LaBelle\\'s song from the 1989 movie Licence to Kill) became her first number-one single in Canada and peaked at number four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.\\nAlso during this time, Dion released the Francophone album Dion chante Plamondon. The album consisted mostly of covers, but featured four new songs: \"Des mots qui sonnent\", \"Je danse dans ma tête\", \"Quelqu\\'un que j\\'aime, quelqu\\'un qui m\\'aime\", and \"L\\'amour existe encore\". It was originally released in Canada and France during the 1991–1992 period, then later received an international release in 1994, the first French Celine Dion album to do so. \"Un garçon pas comme les autres (Ziggy)\" became a smash hit in France, reaching No. 2 and being certified gold. In Quebec, the album was certified Gold the day it was released.\\nBy 1992, Unison, Celine Dion, and numerous high-profile media appearances had propelled Dion to superstardom in North America. She had achieved one of her main objectives: wedging her way into the Anglophone market and achieving fame. However, while she was experiencing rising success in the U.S., her French fans in Canada criticized her for neglecting them. She would later rebuff these criticisms at the 1991 Félix Awards show, where, after winning \"English Artist of the Year\", she openly declined the award. She asserted she was—and would always be—a French, not an English, artist. Indeed, to this day she speaks English with a noticeable Quebec French accent. Apart from her commercial success, there were also changes in her personal life, as Angélil, who was 26 years her senior, transitioned from manager to lover. However, the relationship was kept a secret as they both feared the public would find it inappropriate.\\n\\n1993–1995: The Colour of My Love and D\\'eux\\nIn 1993, Dion announced her feelings for her manager by declaring him \"the colour of [her] love\" in the dedication section of her third English-language album The Colour of My Love. However, instead of criticizing their relationship as she had feared, fans embraced the couple. Eventually, Angélil and Dion married in an extravagant wedding ceremony on 17 December 1994, which was broadcast live on Canadian television.\\nAs with most of her catalogue, The Colour of My Love had over-riding themes of love and romance. It became her most successful record up to point, selling more than six million copies in the U.S., two million in Canada, and peaking at No. 1 in many countries. The album also spawned Dion\\'s first US, Canadian, and Australian No. 1 single \"The Power of Love\" (a remake of Jennifer Rush\\'s 1985 hit), which would become her signature hit in various nations until she reached new career heights in the late 1990s.\\nThe single \"When I Fall in Love\", a duet with Clive Griffin, achieved moderate success on the U.S. and Canadian charts and was nominated for two Grammy Awards, winning one. The Colour of My Love also became Dion\\'s first major hit in Europe, particularly in the United Kingdom. Both the album and the single \"Think Twice\" simultaneously occupied the top of the British charts for five consecutive weeks. \"Think Twice\", which remained at No. 1 for seven weeks, eventually became the fourth single by a female artist to sell in excess of one million copies in the UK while the album was eventually certified five-times platinum for two million copies sold.\\nDion kept to her French roots and continued to release many Francophone recordings between each English record. Generally, they achieved more credibility than her English-language works. She released À l\\'Olympia, a live album recorded during one of her concerts at the Paris Olympia in 1994. It had one promotional single, a live version of \"Calling You\", which peaked at seventy-five on the French Singles Chart. She also recorded a bilingual version of \"Petit Papa Noël\" with Alvin and the Chipmunks for the 1994 holiday album A Very Merry Chipmunk. D\\'eux (also known as The French Album in the United States), was released in 1995, and it would go on to become the best-selling French-language album of all time. The album was mostly written and produced by Jean-Jacques Goldman, and amassed huge success with the singles \"Pour que tu m\\'aimes encore\" and \"Je sais pas\". \"Pour que tu m\\'aimes encore\" reached No. 1 in France and stayed at the top position for twelve weeks. It was later certified Platinum in France. The single reached the top ten in the UK and Ireland, a rare accomplishment for a French song. The second single off the album, \"Je sais pas\", reached No. 1 on the French Singles Chart as well and was certified Silver there.\\nDuring the mid-1990s and onward, Dion\\'s albums were generally constructed on the basis of melodramatic soft rock ballads, with sprinklings of up-tempo pop and rare forays into other genres. She collaborated with writers and producers such as Jim Steinman and David Foster, who helped her to develop a signature sound. While critical reviews fluctuated, her releases performed increasingly well on the international charts, and in 1996, she won the World Music Award for \"World\\'s Best-selling Female Recording Artist of the Year\" for the third time. By the mid-1990s, she had established herself as one of the best-selling artists in the world.\\n\\n1996–1999: Falling into You, Let\\'s Talk About Love, and S\\'il suffisait d\\'aimer\\nIn the five years since her debut English language album in 1990, Billboard stated she had already sold 40 million albums worldwide. Falling into You (1996), Dion\\'s fourth English-language album, presented Dion at the height of her popularity and showed a further progression of her music. In an attempt to reach a wider audience, the album combined many elements, such as complex orchestral sounds, African chanting, and elaborate musical effects. Additionally, instruments like the violin, Spanish guitar, trombone, the cavaquinho, and saxophone created a new sound. The singles encompassed a variety of musical styles. The title track \"Falling into You\" and \"River Deep – Mountain High\" (a Tina Turner cover) made prominent use of percussion instruments; \"It\\'s All Coming Back to Me Now\" (produced by its writer, Jim Steinman) and a remake of Eric Carmen\\'s \"All by Myself\" maintained a soft-rock atmosphere, combined with the classical sound of the piano; and the No. 1 single \"Because You Loved Me\", which was written by Diane Warren, was a pop ballad served as the theme to the 1996 film Up Close and Personal.\\nFalling into You garnered career-best reviews for Dion. While Dan Leroy wrote it was not very different from her previous work with Stephen Holden of The New York Times and Natalie Nichols of the Los Angeles Times writing the album was \"formulaic\", other critics, such as Chuck Eddy of Entertainment Weekly, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, and Daniel Durchholz, lavished the album as \"compelling\", \"passionate\", \"stylish\", \"elegant\", and \"remarkably well-crafted\". Falling into You became Dion\\'s most critically and commercially successful album, topping the charts in many countries and becoming one of the best-selling albums of all time.\\nIn 2013, CBC Music ranked Falling into You 33rd in their list of the 100 greatest Canadian albums ever. In the United States, the album reached No. 1, and was later certified 12× Platinum for over 12 million copies shipped. In Canada, the album was certified diamond for over one million copies shipped. The IFPI certified Falling into You 9× Platinum, an accolade has been given to only two other albums in history, with one of the two being Dion\\'s own album, Let\\'s Talk About Love. The album also won Grammy Awards for Best Pop Album and the academy\\'s highest honour, Album of the Year. Dion was asked to perform \"The Power of the Dream\" at the opening ceremony of the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games. In March 1996, she launched the Falling into You Tour in support of her new album, performing concerts around the world for over a year.\\n\\n She followed Falling into You with Let\\'s Talk About Love (1997), which was publicized as its sequel. The recording process took place in London, New York City, and Los Angeles, and featured a host of special guests, such as Barbra Streisand on \"Tell Him\"; the Bee Gees on \"Immortality\"; and tenor Luciano Pavarotti on \"I Hate You Then I Love You\". Other musicians included Carole King, George Martin, Bryan Adams and Jamaican singer Diana King, who added a reggae tinge to \"Treat Her Like a Lady\".\\nLet\\'s Talk About Love was another major success, reaching No. 1 all over the world, attaining platinum status in twenty-four sales territories, and becoming the fastest selling album of her career. In the United States, the album topped the chart in its seventh week of release, and was later certified 11× Platinum in the U.S. for over 11 million copies shipped. In Canada, the album sold 230,212 copies in its first week of release, which remains a record. It was eventually certified diamond in Canada for over one million copies shipped. The most successful single from the album was the classically influenced ballad \"My Heart Will Go On\", which was written and composed by James Horner and Will Jennings, and produced by Horner and Walter Afanasieff.\\nServing as the love theme for the 1997 blockbuster film Titanic, the song topped the charts across the world and became Dion\\'s signature song. Horner and Jennings won the Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Original Song, while Dion herself garnered two Grammy Awards for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and the most coveted, Record of the Year, (the song itself won four awards, but two were presented to the songwriters). \"My Heart Will Go On\" and \"Think Twice\" made her the only female artist in the UK to have two singles to sell more than a million copies. In support of her album, she embarked on the Let\\'s Talk About Love Tour between 1998 and 1999.\\nDion ended the 1990s with three more extremely successful albums: the Christmas album These Are Special Times (1998), the French-language album, S\\'il suffisait d\\'aimer, and the compilation album All the Way... A Decade of Song (1999). On These Are Special Times, she co-wrote the song \"Don\\'t Save It All for Christmas Day\" along with Ric Wake and Peter Zizzo. The album was her most classically influenced yet, with orchestral arrangements found on virtually every track. The album featured the single \"I\\'m Your Angel\" (a duet with R. Kelly), which became her fourth US No. 1 single, and a smash hit across the world. The album\\'s second single \"The Prayer\" (a duet with Andrea Bocelli) served as the soundtrack of the 1998 film Quest for Camelot and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. All the Way... A Decade of Song drew together her most successful hits coupled with seven new songs, including the lead-off single \"That\\'s the Way It Is\", a cover of Roberta Flack\\'s \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\", and \"All the Way\", a duet with Frank Sinatra. All the Way became one of the best-selling compilation albums of all time, reaching No. 1 in the United States for three weeks. The album was later certified 7× Platinum in the U.S. for 7 million copies shipped. It also topped the charts in the UK, Canada, and Australia. Her last French-language studio album of the 1990s, S\\'il suffisait d\\'aimer, was very successful as well, topping the charts in every major French-speaking country, including France, Switzerland, the Wallonia region of Belgium, and Canada. In France, the album was certified diamond, selling 1.5 million copies. By the end of the 1990s, Dion had sold more than 130 million records worldwide, and had won a slew of industry awards. Her status as one of the music industry\\'s biggest pop divas was further solidified when she was asked to perform on VH1\\'s Divas Live special in 1998, with superstars Aretha Franklin, Gloria Estefan, Shania Twain, and Mariah Carey. That year, she also received two of the highest Canadian honours: \"Officer of the Order of Canada for Outstanding Contribution to the World of Contemporary Music\" and \"Officer of the National Order of Quebec\". A year later, she was inducted into the Canadian Broadcast Hall of Fame, and was honoured with a star on Canada\\'s Walk of Fame.\\nStarting from the mid-1990s, the pop rock influence more noticeable in her earlier releases was replaced by a more mature feel. Additionally, the recurring theme of \"love\" dominated most of her releases, which led to some critics dismissing her music as banal. Other critics, like Elysa Gardner and Jose F. Promis, praised her voice during this period, describing it as a \"technical marvel\". Steve Dollar, in his review of These Are Special Times, opined Dion was a \"vocal Olympian for whom there ain\\'t no mountain—or scale—high enough\".\\n\\n2000–2003: Hiatus, A New Day Has Come, One Heart, and 1 fille & 4 types\\nAfter releasing and promoting thirteen albums during the 1990s, Dion stated she needed to settle down, and announced on her latest album All the Way... A Decade of Song, she needed to take a step back from the spotlight and enjoy life. Angélil\\'s diagnosis with esophageal cancer also prompted her to hiatus. While on break, she was unable to escape the spotlight. In 2000, the National Enquirer published a false story about Dion. Brandishing a picture of Dion and her husband, the magazine misquoted her, printing the headline, \"Celine — \\'I\\'m Pregnant With Twins!\\'\" She sued the magazine for more than $20 million. The editors printed an apology and a full retraction in the next issue, and donated money to the American Cancer Society in honour of her and her husband. A year after the incident, after undergoing fertility treatments, she gave birth to a son, René-Charles Dion Angélil, on 25 January 2001, in Florida.\\nFollowing the 11 September attacks, Dion returned to the music scene, and in a televised performance sang \"God Bless America\" at the benefit concert America: A Tribute to Heroes. Chuck Taylor of Billboard wrote, \"the performance ... brings to mind what has made her one of the celebrated vocalists of our time: the ability to render emotion that shakes the soul. Affecting, meaningful, and filled with grace, this is a musical reflection to share with all of us still searching for ways to cope.\" She performed it again in 2003 during pregame festivities for Super Bowl XXXVII in Qualcomm Stadium. In December 2001, she published her autobiography, My Story, My Dream, which chronicled her rags-to-riches story.\\nDion ended her three-year sabbatical from the music industry with the aptly titled album A New Day Has Come, released in March 2002. The album was her most personal yet, with songs focusing on her motherhood and maturation as a woman such as \"A New Day Has Come\", and \"Goodbye\\'s (The Saddest Word)\". She stated: \"Becoming a mother makes you a grown-up.\" She also stated: \"A New Day Has Come, for Rene, for me, is the baby. It has everything to do with the baby ... The song \"A New Day Has Come\" represents very well the mood I\\'m feeling right now. It represents the whole album.\" A New Day Has Come debuted at No. 1 in more than 17 countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada. In the United States, the album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 527,000 copies; marking her first No. 1 debut on the chart, as well as the highest debut sales week of her career in the U.S. It was eventually certified 3× Platinum in the United States, and 6× Platinum in Canada.\\nWhile the album was commercially successful, critical reviews suggested it was \"forgettable\" and the lyrics were \"lifeless\". Both Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone, and Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly, stated Dion\\'s music had not developed much during her break, and classed her material as trite and mediocre. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the album \"a lengthy collection of drippy, gooey pop fluffer-nutter\". The first single off the album, A New Day Has Come peaked at No.22 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, being an airplay-only release. On the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks, however, the song spent 21 consecutive weeks at No. 1, breaking the record for the longest span at the top. The previous record holders were Phil Collins\\' You\\'ll Be in My Heart and Dion\\'s own Because You Loved Me, both of which lasted nineteen weeks at No. 1. The album\\'s next single, \"I\\'m Alive\", was featured on the soundtrack for Stuart Little 2 (2002), and was ranked number 2 on the European Hot 100 Singles, and number 6 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks in the United States. During 2002, she performed for many benefit concerts, including her second appearance on VH1 Divas Live, a concert to benefit the VH1 Save The Music Foundation, alongside Cher, Anastacia, Dixie Chicks, Mary J. Blige, Whitney Houston, Cyndi Lauper, Shakira, and Stevie Nicks.\\nIn conjunction with an endorsement deal with Chrysler, she released One Heart (2003), an album representing her appreciation for life. The album largely consisted of pop and dance music—a deviation from the soaring, melodramatic ballads, for which she had been known. Although the album achieved moderate success, One Heart was met with mixed criticism, and words such as \"predictable\" and \"banal\" appeared even in the most lenient reviews. A cover of the 1989 Cyndi Lauper hit \"I Drove All Night\", released to launch her advertising campaign with Chrysler, incorporated elements of dance-pop and rock and roll. The advertising deal was met with criticism, with some stating Dion was trying to cater to her sponsors.\\nAfter One Heart, she released her next English-language studio album, Miracle (2004). Miracle was a multimedia project conceived by Dion and Australian photographer Anne Geddes and had a theme centring on babies and motherhood. The album was filled with lullabies and other songs of maternal love and inspiration, including covers of Louis Armstrong\\'s \"What a Wonderful World\" and John Lennon\\'s \"Beautiful Boy\". The reviews for Miracle were mixed. Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album three of out five stars, stating, \"The worst you can say about the record is that there are no surprises, but the audience for this record doesn\\'t want surprises; they want comfort, whether it arrives in polished music or artsy photos of newborns, and Miracle provides both, which makes it appealing for those expectant or new mothers in Dion\\'s audience.\" Chuck Taylor of Billboard wrote the single \"Beautiful Boy\" was \"an unexpected gem\" and called Dion \"a timeless, enormously versatile artist\", Chuck Arnold of People, however, labelled the album as excessively sentimental, while Nancy Miller of Entertainment Weekly opined that \"the whole earth-mama act is just opportunism, reborn\". Miracle debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 chart and No. 1 in Canada and was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA.\\nThe francophone album 1 fille & 4 types (1 Girl & 4 Guys), released in October 2003, fared better than her previous two releases and showed her trying to distance herself from the \"diva\" image. She recruited Jean-Jacques Goldman, Gildas Arzel, Eric Benzi, and Jacques Veneruso, with whom she had previously worked on two of her best-selling French albums S\\'il suffisait d\\'aimer and D\\'eux. Labeled \"the album of pleasure\" by Dion herself, the album cover showed her in a simple and relaxed manner, contrary to the choreographed poses usually found on her album covers. The album achieved widespread commercial success in France, Canada, and Belgium where it reached No. 1. In France, the album debuted at No. 1 and was later certified 2× platinum after selling over 700,000 copies. Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote Dion\\'s vocals were \"back at top of their game\" and she was \"getting back to pop basics and performing at a level unheard in a while\".\\nThough her albums were commercially successful, they did not achieve the sales or the reception of her previous works. Her songs received less airplay as radio became less embracing of balladeers like Dion, Carey, and Houston, and was focused on more up-tempo, urban/hip-hop songs. By 2004, Dion had accumulated sales of more than 175 million albums worldwide and received the Chopard Diamond Award from the World Music Awards for her achievements. According to the official World Music Awards website, the award is rare; it is \"not presented every year\" and an artist can be presented with the award only for selling \"over 100 million albums during their career\".\\n\\n2003–2007: A New Day...\\nIn early 2002, Dion announced a three-year, 600-show contract to appear five nights a week in an entertainment extravaganza, A New Day..., at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace. This move was generally seen as risky, but journalist Miriam Nunzio wrote it was \"one of the smartest business decisions in years by any major recording artist\". Dion conceived the show after seeing O by Franco Dragone during her break from recording, and it premiered on 25 March 2003, in a 4,000-seat arena specifically designed for her show and modelled after the Roman Colosseum. Many stars attended the opening night including Dick Clark, Alan Thicke, Kathy Griffin, Lance Bass, and Justin Timberlake, who hosted the television special. The show, directed by Dragone and choreographed by Mia Michaels, was a combination of dance, music, and visual effects. It included Dion performing her biggest hits against an array of dancers and special effects. Reviewer Mike Weatherford felt that, at first, Dion was not as relaxed as she should be, and at times, it was hard to find her among the excessive stage ornamentation and dancers. However, he noted the show had become more enjoyable over the course of its run, because of her improved stage-presence and simplified costumes.\\nThe show was well received by audiences; it routinely sold out until its end in late 2007. Ticket prices averaged  US $135.33. According to Pollstar, Dion sold 322,000 tickets and grossed US $43.9 million in the first half of 2005, and by July 2005, she had sold out 315 out of 384 shows. By the end of 2005, she grossed more than US $76 million, placing sixth on Billboard\\'s Money Makers list for 2005. Because of the show\\'s success, her contract was extended into 2007 for an undisclosed sum. On 5 January 2007, it was announced the show would end on 15 December 2007, with tickets for the period after October 2007 having gone on sale from 1 March. According to Billboard, A New Day... is the most successful residency of all time, grossing over US$385 million ($565.73 million in 2023 dollars) and drawing nearly three million people to 717 shows. The Live in Las Vegas: A New Day... DVD was released on 10 December 2007, in Europe and the following day in North America.\\n\\n2007–2010: D\\'elles, Taking Chances, and Taking Chances Tour\\nOn 21 May 2007, Dion released the French-language album D\\'elles (About Them), which debuted at the top of the Canadian album charts, selling 72,200 copies in its first week. It marked her tenth No. 1 album in the SoundScan era, and her eighth debut at the top position. In Canada, the album has been certified 2× platinum, and within the first month had already shipped half a million units worldwide. D\\'Elles also reached No. 1 in France and Belgium. The first single \"Et s\\'il n\\'en restait qu\\'une (je serais celle-là)\" (meaning \"And If There Was Only One Woman Left (I Would Be That One)\") debuted at the top of the French singles chart a month earlier. Later in same year, she released the English album Taking Chances on 12 November in Europe, and 13 November in North America. Her first English studio album since 2003\\'s One Heart, it featured pop, R&B, and rock inspired music. For this album, she collaborated with John Shanks and ex-Evanescence guitarist Ben Moody, as well as Kristian Lundin, Peer Åström, Linda Perry, Japanese singer Yuna Ito, and R&B singer and songwriter Ne-Yo. Dion stated, \"I think this album represents a positive evolution in my career ... I\\'m feeling strong, maybe a little gutsier than in the past, and just as passionate about music and life as I ever was.\" She launched her year-long global Taking Chances Tour on 14 February 2008 in South Africa, performing 132 dates in stadiums and arenas across 5 continents.\\nThe Taking Chances Tour was a great success in the United States, reaching the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Boxscore, having sold out every concert in the U.S. and Canada. In addition, she appeared on Idol Gives Back for a second year in a row. Dion was nominated for six Juno Awards in 2008, adding to her 53 previous nominations (an all-time record). Her nominations included Artist of the Year, Pop Album of the Year (for Taking Chances), Francophone Album of the Year (for D\\'elles) and Album of the Year (for both Taking Chances and D\\'elles). The following year, she was nominated for 3 Juno Awards including the Fan Choice Award, Song of the Year (for \"Taking Chances\"), and Music DVD of the Year (for Live in Las Vegas: A New Day...)\\n\\nOn 22 August 2008, Dion presented a free outdoor concert, mostly in French, on the Plains of Abraham, for the 400th anniversary of Quebec City. The celebration gathered approximately 490,000 people. The concert, called Céline sur les Plaines, was released on DVD on 11 November 2008, in Quebec and was released on 20 May 2009, in France. Late October 2008 saw the worldwide release of a comprehensive English-language greatest hits album, My Love: Essential Collection.\\nIn May 2009, Dion was named the 20th best-selling artist of the decade and the second-best-selling female artist of the decade in the United States, selling an estimated 17.57 million copies of her albums there since 2000. In June 2009, Forbes reported she earned $100 million during 2008. In December 2009, Pollstar announced she was the highest-grossing solo live music act in North America of the decade, second overall behind only the Dave Matthews Band. She grossed $522.2 million during the decade, a large portion of the sum coming from her five-year residency at Caesars Palace.\\nIn January 2010, the Los Angeles Times presented its annual list of the top ten largest earners of the year, revealing Dion took the top spot for the entire decade, with $747.9 million in total revenue from 2000 to 2009. The largest haul came from ticket sales, totalling $522.2 million. Additionally, she was named \"Artist of the Decade\" in Quebec, announced by Le Journal de Québec in December 2009. A public online survey asked responders to vote for whom they believe deserved the above-mentioned accolade.\\nOn 17 February 2010, Dion released into theatres a documentary film about her Taking Chances Tour, titled, Celine: Through the Eyes of the World. The documentary shows behind-the-scenes footage of her both onstage and offstage, along with footage of her with her family as they travelled the world with her. The distributor is the Sony Pictures subsidiary, Hot Ticket. The film was later released on Blu-ray and DVD on 4 May 2010, along with the CD/DVD, Taking Chances World Tour: The Concert. At the 52nd Grammy Awards in February 2010, Dion joined Carrie Underwood, Usher, Jennifer Hudson, and Smokey Robinson to perform the song \"Earth Song\" during the 3-D Michael Jackson tribute.\\nFurthermore, in a May 2010 Harris Poll, Dion was named the most popular musician in the United States, ahead of U2, Elvis Presley, and The Beatles while factoring in gender, political affiliations, geographic region of residence, and income. Specifically, she was the most popular musician in the female demographic, as well as among all Democrats, those who live in the eastern United States and southern United States, and those who have incomes between US$35k and US$74.9k. In September 2010, she released the single \"Voler\", a duet with French singer Michel Sardou. The song was later included on Sardou\\'s album. In addition, it was announced in October 2010 Dion wrote and composed a new song for Canadian singer, Marc Dupré entitled \"Entre deux mondes\".\\n\\n2011–2014: Celine, Sans attendre, and Loved Me Back to Life\\nIn an interview with People published in February 2010, Dion announced she would be returning to Caesars Palace for Celine, a three-year residency for seventy shows a year, beginning 15 March 2011. She stated the show will feature, \"all the songs from my repertoire people want to hear\" and will contain a selection of music from classic Hollywood films. To promote her return to Las Vegas, Dion made an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show on 21 February, during the show\\'s final season, marking her record twenty-seventh appearance. In 2018, Billboard stated her residency Celine is the second most successful residency of all time. By the end of 2011, Dion has sold 331,000 albums (despite not releasing any studio album since 2007) and 956,000 digital tracks in the United States.\\nFor a record sixth time, she performed at the 83rd Academy Awards, where she sang the song \"Smile\", as part of the ceremony\\'s \"In Memoriam\" segment. On 4 September, she appeared on the 2011 MDA Labor Telethon Event and presented a prerecorded performance of \"Open Arms\" from her new Las Vegas show. On 1 October 2011, the OWN Network premiered a documentary on Dion\\'s life, detailing the months before, during and after her pregnancy, to the makings of her new Las Vegas Show, called, \"Celine: 3 Boys and a New Show\". The documentary became the second highest rated show on TV OWN Canada. In October, FlightNetwork.com conducted a poll asking 780 participants which celebrity they would most like to sit next to on an airplane. Dion was the top favourite, with 23.7% of the vote. Also, in September, she released the 14th perfume from her Celine Dion Parfums Collection, called \"Signature\". On 15 September, she made an appearance at the free concert of Andrea Bocelli in Central Park. In 2012, she performed at the 16th Jazz and Blues Festival in Jamaica.\\nIn October 2012, Sony Music Entertainment released The Best of Celine Dion & David Foster in Asia. She began recording songs for her next English and French albums during April and May 2012. The French-language album, Sans attendre was released on 2 November 2012, and was a smash success in all French-speaking territories, especially in France where it achieved diamond status. The English-language album was postponed to 1 November 2013. Titled Loved Me Back to Life, it included collaborations with an exceptional team of songwriters and producers, including duets with Ne-Yo and Stevie Wonder. The lead single, \"Loved Me Back to Life\" was released on 3 September 2013. Dion embarked on the Sans attendre Tour in November 2013 and performed in Belgium and France. \"Breakaway\", \"Incredible\" and \"Water and a Flame\" were chosen as next singles.

However, on 20 March 2015, she announced she would be returning to The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in late August 2015. On 14 January 2016, she cancelled the rest of the January performances due to her husband\\'s and her brother\\'s deaths from cancer.

On 24 September 2018, she announced the end of her Las Vegas residency Celine, with the final date set for 8 June 2019. She is working on a new English album. In January 2019, she performed \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" at the \"Aretha! A Grammy Celebration for the Queen of Soul\" Franklin\\'s tribute concert, to be broadcast in March 2019.

On 3 April 2019, during a Facebook Live event, Dion announced her 2019/2020 Courage World Tour, beginning in Quebec City on 18 September 2019. She also announced a new English-language album of the same name, released in November 2019. Courage debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 dated 30 November 2019, earning Dion her first US number-one album in 17 years, having last topped the chart with A New Day Has Come (2002). It is her fifth US number-one album, and earned 113,000 album-equivalent units, including 109,000 pure album sales. It also became her 13th top ten album on the Billboard 200. Thanks to Courage, Dion has collected number-one albums in each of the last three decades, being the fourth woman to achieve the feat after Janet Jackson, Barbra Streisand and Britney Spears. The album also debuted at number one in Canada, becoming Dion\\'s 15th number-one album in the Nielsen SoundScan era and 16th overall in the country.\\nOn 18 September 2019, Dion released three songs, \"Lying Down\", \"Courage\", and \"Imperfections\" from her upcoming album, Courage. On 26 February 2020, Dion released two songs as exclusive Spotify singles: an acoustic version of Imperfections, and a cover of Chris Isaak\\'s \"Wicked Game\". Isaak joined Dion and sang vocals on the track. On 10 June 2020, Dion announced her Courage World Tour will kick off again in 2021, after the tour was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 21 May 2021, it was announced Dion would return to Las Vegas, in November of the same year, for a limited-run installment of ten dates in collaboration with Resorts World Las Vegas. Billboard listed Dion as the third top paid musician of 2020 (second by female artist), with total of earnings of $17.5 million. Dion contributed vocals to the song \"Superwoman\" on Diane Warren\\'s 2021 album Diane Warren: The Cave Sessions Vol. 1.\\n\\n2022–present: Health problems and acting debut\\nOn 15 January 2022, Dion canceled her North American tour dates because of severe muscle spasms. On 8 December, Dion announced she had been diagnosed with stiff-person syndrome, a rare neurological disease. She said the disease affected every aspect of her life, making it difficult to walk, and affected her vocal cords. All her tour dates were cancelled. On 25 June, 2024, Amazon MGM Studios released a documentary about Dion\\'s life with stiff-person syndrome, I Am: Celine Dion. The I Am: Celine Dion soundtrack was released on 21 June.\\nIn 2023, Dion starred as herself in Love Again, her first acting appearance in a feature film. She also recorded five new songs for the soundtrack, released on 12 May; the first single, \"Love Again\" premiered on 13 April. On 3 May, a mashup remix of Dion\\'s \"I\\'m Alive\" and the Whispers\\' 1979 song \"And the Beat Goes On\" was released. The single, by Majestic, the Jammin Kid, also includes Dion as a lead credit. The single debuted at number 6 on the UK Singles Downloads Chart.\\n\\nArtistry\\nInfluences\\nDion cites idols as varied as Michael Jackson, Aretha Franklin, Charles Aznavour, Carole King, Anne Murray, Barbra Streisand, Whitney Houston and the Bee Gees, most of whom she would eventually collaborate with. Michael Jackson in particular was a major motivation for her to learn English as early as in the 1980s. Her music has been influenced by numerous genres, including pop, rock, gospel, R&B, and soul, and her lyrics focus on themes of poverty, world hunger, and spirituality, with an emphasis on love and romance. After the birth of her first child, her work increasingly focused on maternal love.\\n\\nMusical style\\nDion has faced considerable criticism from critics, who state that her music often retreats behind pop and soul conventions, and is marked by excessive sentimentality. According to Keith Harris of Rolling Stone magazine, \"[Dion\\'s] sentimentality is bombastic and defiant rather than demure and retiring ... [she] stands at the end of the chain of drastic devolution that goes Aretha–Whitney–Mariah. Far from being an aberration, Dion actually stands as a symbol of a certain kind of pop sensibility—bigger is better, too much is never enough, and the riper the emotion the more true.\" Her francophone releases, by contrast, tend to be deeper and more varied than her English releases, and consequently have achieved more credibility.\\nCritics have stated that Dion\\'s involvement in the production aspect of her music is fundamentally lacking, which results in her work being overproduced and impersonal. However, coming from a family in which all of her siblings were musicians, she dabbled in learning how to play instruments like piano and guitar, and practised with a Fender Stratocaster during the recording sessions for her album Falling into You.\\nOccasionally, Dion has contributed to the writing of a handful of her English and French songs, as well as writing a few songs for other artists such as Marc Dupre. Additionally, as her career progressed, she found herself taking charge in the production of her albums. On her first English album, which she recorded before she had a firm command of the English language, she expressed disapproval, which could have been avoided if she had assumed more creative input. By the time she released her second English album Celine Dion, she assumed more control of the production and recording process, hoping to dispel earlier criticisms. She stated, \"On the second album I said, \\'Well, I have the choice to be afraid one more time and not be 100% happy, or not be afraid and be part of this album.\\' This is my album.\" Besides her contributions to some of her early French albums, Dion wrote a few of the songs on Let\\'s Talk About Love (1997) and These Are Special Times (1998).\\nShe is often the subject of media ridicule and parody and is frequently impersonated on shows such as MADtv, Saturday Night Live, South Park, Royal Canadian Air Farce, and This Hour Has 22 Minutes for her strong accent and onstage gesticulations. However, she has stated that she is unaffected by the comments, and is flattered that people take the time to impersonate her. She even invited Ana Gasteyer, who parodied her on SNL, to appear onstage during one of her performances in New York City. While she is rarely politically outspoken, in 2005 following the Hurricane Katrina disaster, Dion appeared on Larry King Live and tearfully criticized the US government\\'s slow response in aiding the victims of the hurricane: \"There\\'s people still there waiting to be rescued. To me that is not acceptable ... How can it be so easy to send planes in another country to kill everybody in a second and destroy lives. We need to serve our country.\" After her interview, she stated, \"When I do interviews with Larry King or the big TV shows like that, they put you on the spot, which is very difficult. I do have an opinion, but I\\'m a singer. I\\'m not a politician.\"\\n\\nVoice and timbre\\nDion once claimed herself to be a mezzo-soprano. However, attempts to adapt classical voice types to other forms of singing have been met with controversy. Kent Nagano, maestro of the Munich Symphony Orchestra, remarked, \"All you just sang was soprano\", after Dion auditioned with two solos from Carmen, wanting to know if she could sing opera. Her timbre has been described as \"thin, slightly nasal\" with a \"raspy\" lower register and \"bell glass-like high notes\".\\nAccording to Linda Lister in Divafication: The Deification of Modern Female Pop Stars, she has been described as a reigning \"Queen of Pop\" for her influence over the recording industry during the 1990s, alongside other female artists, including Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. In a countdown of the \"22 Greatest Voices in Music\" by Blender Magazine and MTV, she placed ninth (sixth for a female), and she was also placed fourth in Cover Magazine\\'s list of \"The 100 Outstanding Pop Vocalists\". MTV Australia ranked Dion at fourth place in their list of Top 10 music divas of all time. Dion is often compared to Houston and Carey for her vocal style, and to her idol Barbra Streisand for her voice.\\nShe is often praised for her technical virtuosity. Jim Santella of The Buffalo News writes \"Like an iron fist in a velvet glove, the power of Celine Dion\\'s voice is cloaked in a silky vibrato that betrays the intensity of her vocal commitment.\" Jeff Miers, also of The Buffalo News, says of Dion \"Her singing voice is absolutely extra-human. She hits notes in full voice, with a controlled vibrato and an incredible conception of pitch, like she\\'s shucking an ear of corn.\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times states that Dion has \"a good-sized arsenal of technical skills. She can deliver tricky melismas, produce expressive vocal catches and sustain long notes without the tiniest wavering of pitch. And as her duets ... have shown, she is a reliable harmony voice.\" In an interview with Libération, Jean-Jacques Goldman notes that she has \"no problem of accuracy or tempo\". According to Kent Nagano, she is \"a musician who has a good ear, a refinement, and a degree of perfection that is enviable\". Charles Alexander of Time states, \"[Her] voice glides effortlessly from deep whispers to dead-on high notes, a sweet siren that combines force with grace.\"\\nIn her French repertoire, Dion adorns her vocals with more nuances and expressiveness, with the emotional intensity being \"more tender and intimate\". Additionally, Luc Plamondon, a French singer-songwriter who has worked closely with Dion claims that there are three chanteuses (stylistically) that she uses: the Québécois, the French, and the American. Her self-titled 1992 album was promoted with the slogan \"Remember the name because you\\'ll never forget the voice.\"\\n\\nLegacy\\nDion is regarded as one of pop music\\'s most influential vocalists. She has been referred to as the \"Priestess of Pop\". Ed Christman from Billboard called Dion the \"Queen of Pop\". Her music and vocal styling, alongside that of Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, have been said to shape how the bulk of modern female pop vocalists sing. These three artists have been widely credited with reviving the power ballad, and in doing so reshaping the adult contemporary radio format, making it one of the most popular formats of the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2002, Billboard named her as the \"Best-selling contemporary female artist in history\".\\nAccording to producer, musician, and former American Idol judge Randy Jackson, Dion, Houston, and Carey are the voices of the modern era. Music critic and Dion biographer Carl Wilson notes that her \"fame and influence is also renewed and expressed regularly these days by American Idol, the largest mass musical phenomenon of the past decade, where Celine\\'s stood solidly in its pantheon of singers for young people to emulate\". Many contestants on the countless televised talent competitions that have risen at the turn of the millennium often emulate Dion, Houston and Carey and cite them as idols. MTV also praised Dion by saying: \"Céline Dion was better than almost anyone at capitalizing on pop\\'s ability to articulate feelings in sensational, over-the-top ways.\"\\nNumerous artists have either mentioned Dion as a major influence or as one of their favourite singers including: Britney Spears, Rihanna, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato, Adele, Rachelle Ann Go, Josh Groban, Delta Goodrem, Leona Lewis, Jennifer Hudson, Vanessa Hudgens, Kelly Clarkson,  Perrie Edwards, Loren Allred, Brazilian singer Wanessa Camargo, Ariana Grande, Sam Smith, Frank Ocean, Ava Max, Charlotte Cardin, and V among many others. Country singer Martina McBride is widely heralded by the press as the Celine Dion of Country music.\\nMany artists have also praised Dion\\'s voice, singing ability or expressed an interest in working with her including Met Opera conductor and musical director Yannick Nézet-Séguin, Beyoncé, Carlos Santana, Elton John, OneRepublic, Coldplay, Sharon Osbourne, Nicole Scherzinger, Ne-Yo, Carole King, Barbra Streisand, Luciano Pavarotti, Bee Gees, Sir George Martin, Justin Bieber, Jean-Jacques Goldman, Drake and Cher.\\nTimbaland stated \"Celine has such a beautiful, mesmerizing voice. She is so talented. I think we could create something that is a classic like she is already.\" Josh Groban remarked \"She\\'s a powerhouse. In this day and age, when more and more studio-produced, tiny-tiny voices are being rewarded ... she has this extraordinary instrument.\" According to Diane Warren, \"Celine is the best singer by far of her generation\", an opinion shared by Quincy Jones, Tommy Mottola, and David Foster. Moreover, Shania Twain and Jennifer Lopez have praised her dynamic stage presence, with Jennifer Lopez commenting on American Idol: \"Celine gets on stage, she owns the stage, she runs all over that stage, she stops that stage.\" Leona Lewis is also a huge fan of Céline Dion saying \"Celine is someone I aspire to be like in every way. \"Gosh – I can\\'t wait. I\\'m in the middle of picking out dresses at the moment. Celine is definitely one of my heroes. She is amazing.\" American singer and actress Lea Michele said that she listened to Dion\\'s music while in the process of making her sophomore album Places and cited her as one of her vocal influences.\\nGodmother of Soul Patti LaBelle called Dion as one of the greatest singers ever. Pop singer Kelly Clarkson also praised Dion\\'s vocal ability saying: \"she has two sets of lungs when she sings\", and also called her the most gifted vocalist on the planet. Dion holds the Guinness World Record for the most Juno Awards won for Album Of The Year (tied with Michael Bublé and Arcade Fire). She won 3 out of the 13 nominations she received in the category throughout her career. Dion is the third most decorated artist in Juno Awards history, winning 20 out of the 75 total nominations ever, becoming the most nominated artist in the awards history as well. In January 2023, CNN reported that her exclusion from Rolling Stone\\'s list of the 200 greatest singers of all time sparked outrage.\\n\\nCultural impact\\nFrancophone music industry\\nOn a cultural level, Dion is credited for introducing francophone music to many non-francophone countries around the globe. Her albums D\\'eux and S\\'il suffisait d\\'aimer remain the best selling francophone albums in history, gaining unprecedented success in non-Francophone markets such as the United Kingdom, Poland, Netherlands, Portugal, Greece, Austria, Japan, and New Zealand. According to RFI Musique, she \"has done her bit for French music over the years, assuring the success of French songs which would probably never have got beyond Francophone borders without her ... Without Celine, French record sales would be dramatically lower!\" In May 2008, she was awarded France\\'s highest award, as Knight of the Legion of Honour by President of France Nicolas Sarkozy. Sarkozy praised Dion and stated: \"France thanks you because your talent and success have contributed to the influence of the French language outside our borders\".\\n\\nLas Vegas strip\\nShe is also credited for both revitalizing and revolutionizing the entertainment scene in Las Vegas with the gargantuan successes of her residencies there. She signed a $100 million contract for a residency in Vegas, which is considered one of the most lucrative and risky residency contracts in the touring industry.\\nBillboard credits Dion as the one who pioneered modern Las Vegas residencies, saying: \"Since Dion\\'s debut, hundreds of artists have tried their hand at Vegas residencies ... Once considered the domain of artists long past their peak, today\\'s Las Vegas residency shows are big business, generating millions in sales.\" Dion is popularly referred as the reigning \"Queen of Las Vegas\" by various media outlets for her impact and legacy in the city.\\nAccording to Gary Bongiovanni, president and editor-in-chief of Pollstar, \"Celine redefined what artists can do in Las Vegas, helping to make it arguably the busiest entertainment city in the world.\"\\nKurt Melien, vice-president of entertainment at Caesar\\'s Palace, stated \"Celine was a pioneer without question. Twenty years ago, we couldn\\'t have got someone the stature of Britney Spears to appear in Vegas. Stars like her would never have considered it if Celine hadn\\'t paved the way. She changed the face of modern Vegas.\"\\nThe Guardian listed Dion\\'s Vegas residency as one of \"50 gigs that changed music\", saying: \"it was Céline Dion who turned Caesars into the stage for a glorious pop comeback. Her initial five-year run was followed by a further eight years – and prompted copycat turns by Britney Spears, Pink and Katy Perry.\\n\\nEconomy\\nRegarding her financial impact on Las Vegas, Stephen Brown, director of the Centre for Business and Economic Research in Las Vegas, commented: \"People will come to the city just for her and they will spend money and as a consequence, she has an outsized impact on the economy\", then adding \"Bigger than Elvis, Sinatra and Liberace put together? Definitely.\" Estimations indicate that Dion\\'s show will create up to 7,000 indirect jobs and around $114 million worth of new economic activity in each of the three years for which she has been contracted.\\n\\nBusiness\\nForbes also discussed how entrepreneurs can reclaim the power in their business by being like Céline Dion as an example saying: \"Well, remember back in 2017 when Dion launched her handbag line? During a press conference, she admitted her late manager (and husband) had always handled everything for her. Every aspect of her shows was pre-decided; every move, appearance and interview was programmed in advance. She just showed up and executed (which she did brilliantly). At the end of her handbag launch press release, she said \"Now ... I\\'m the boss.\" Starting right then and there, she\\'d be the one calling the shots for her shows, her kids, her handbags and everything else that mattered to her. She was going to do things her way.\"\\n\\nFashion\\nCeline Dion has received various acclaims from fashion critics for reinventing her fashion style over the years. The Guardian called her \"The Joyous New Queen of Fashion\". Harper\\'s Bazaar also praised Dion for being an ultimate fashion risk-taker and called her a \"Fashion Chameleon\". Billboard dubbed her as \"Streetwear Icon\" after recapping the global icon\\'s style evolution through the years. Vogue named her as one of music\\'s most exuberant dressers, beloved as much for her glorious voice as her extravagant sense of style. Tatler discussed in an article how Cardi B might be the next Céline Dion of Paris Fashion Week, proving that Céline is the standard for the occasion. Fashion stylist and image architect Law Roach praised Celine Dion, calling her \"The Queen of Camp\" and \"The Queen of Glitter & Sequins\". Dion further cemented her name in the fashion world by wearing the reverse tuxedo at 1999 Academy Awards, which became one of the most talked ensembles of that time. Vogue also listed her iconic 1999 reverse tuxedo as one of the most controversial looks of all time saying it was undeniably the highlight of the year. W also listed the iconic ensemble as one of the most memorable dresses of all time. In February 2020, Sergio Guadarrama, a contestant of Project Runway, copied the idea of reverse tuxedo and claimed it was his original idea and had even claimed that he had no idea about the iconic tuxedo, which left the fans of the show disappointed.\\n\\nGlobal impact\\nVice discussed how Dion\\'s music made impact in Nigerian culture, saying: \"By the 2000s, Celine Dion was basically the queen of Nigerian airwaves. It was impossible to watch TV or listen to the radio without hearing her music – either on adverts, or in Nollywood films featuring heartthrobs like Genevieve Nnaji and Ramsey Nouah.\"\\nBillboard also discussed how Dion\\'s appearance at Jamaica Jazz & Blues changed the festival\\'s future. According to Walter Elmore, CEO of Art of Music Productions said Dion is by far the most expensive artist he has ever booked, further saying: \"I have already received calls from the management of several major US artists who want to perform here next year because they heard Celine\\'s comments about our show\\'s production quality,\" Elmore said. \"Her performance confirms that we can bring the biggest artists on the planet to our little island.\"\\nIn 2012, Dion visited Jamaica for the first time which broke attendance records and caused traffic congestion around the concert venue. Vice discussed how Dion\\'s music has been constant in dancehall clubs for decades, as many Jamaican dancehall artists cover her songs and remixing her ballads into anthems of dance hall. Further adding: \"Several current dancehall musicians continue to use utilize Dion\\'s tunes with the addition of upbeat guitars, pan flutes, and backbeat shuffles that transform the music for consumption by dancehall fans.\"\\n\\nReference in other music\\nThe Canadian comedy music group the Arrogant Worms released an album, Dirt, in 1999 which contained a song, \"Celine Dion\", about Dion\\'s stalker-like affection for her.

She is notably the national celebrity patron for Cystic Fibrosis Canada and honorary patron of the CHU Sainte-Justine. In addition, through her foundation, she also helps children in need and their families here in Canada and abroad.\"\\nBy the end of 1998, Dion was recognized by Billboard as the \"Woman of the Year\".

The demand caused them to add two additional shows eventually.\\n\\nOther activities\\nBusiness endeavours\\nLes Productions Feeling Inc., also known as Feeling Inc. or just Feeling, is an artist management company based in Laval, Québec, Canada, and owned by Dion and her husband and manager, Rene Angélil. She is also founder of Nickels Restaurant food chain. She and her husband also own Le Mirage Golf Club and Schwartz\\'s Restaurant.

She has promoted the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CCFF) since 1982, and became the foundation\\'s National Celebrity Patron in 1993. She has an emotional attachment to the foundation; her niece Karine died from the disease at the age of sixteen, in Dion\\'s arms. In 2003, she joined a number of other celebrities, athletes, and politicians, including Josh Groban and Yolanda Adams, to support \"World Children\\'s Day\", a global fundraising effort sponsored by McDonald\\'s. The effort raised money from more than 100 nations and benefited orphanages and children\\'s health organizations. In addition, she has been a major supporter of the T. J. Martell Foundation, the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Fund, and many health and educational campaigns. During the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, she donated $1 million to the victims of the storm, and held a fund-raising event for the victims of the 2004 Asian tsunami, which subsequently raised more than $1 million.

The campaign resulted in $30,000 as donation.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nAs the youngest of 14 children, Dion grew up wearing hand-me-downs and sharing a bed with several sisters. As a baby, she slept in a drawer to save on a crib. She was bullied at school and called \"Vampire\", owing to her teeth and skinny frame. Local tabloids even dubbed her \"Canine Dion\" in the teenage years of her career. She often spoke of running home from school to play music in the basement with her brothers and sisters. \"I detested school\", she would later write in her autobiography. \"I had always lived surrounded by adults and children a lot older than me. I learned everything I needed to know from them. As far as I was concerned, real life existed around them.\" Dion\\'s eldest sister was already in her twenties, married, and pregnant with her first child at the time Dion\\'s mother, Thérèse, was pregnant with Celine.\\nDion first met René Angélil, her future husband and manager, in 1980, when she was 12 and he was 38, after her brother, Michel Dondalinger Dion, had sent him a demonstration recording of \"Ce n\\'était qu\\'un rêve\" (\"It Was Only a Dream/Nothing but a Dream\"), a song she, her mother Thérèse, and her brother Jacques Dion had jointly written. Over subsequent years, Angélil guided her to stardom in francophone territories.\\nAfter the dissolution (around 1985) of Angélil\\'s second marriage, he and Dion took a break from each other professionally, and he spent the major part of the year in Las Vegas, while Dion was learning English and taking dance and vocal lessons in Montreal. Upon his return, \"he avoided being alone with me for too long a time\", she said in her 2000 autobiography My Story, My Dream. Meanwhile, she kept a photo of Angélil under her pillow, later writing, \"Before I fell asleep, I slipped it under the pillow, out of fear that my mother, who always shared a room with me, would find it.\" She also wrote \"Less and less could I hide from myself the fact that I was in love with René; I had all the symptoms,\" and \"I was in love with a man I couldn\\'t love, who didn\\'t want me to love him, who didn\\'t want to love me.\" Dion\\'s mother, who traveled everywhere with her until she was 19, was initially wary of her growing infatuation with a much older and twice-divorced Angélil, but Dion was insistent, telling her mother \"I\\'m not a minor. This is a free country. No one has the right to prevent me from loving whoever I want to.\"\\nTheir professional relationship eventually turned romantic after Dion\\'s win at the Eurovision Song Contest in Dublin in 1988; she was 20. The romance was known to only family and friends for five years, though Dion nearly revealed all in a tearful 1992 interview with journalist Lise Payette. Many years later, Payette penned the song \"Je cherche l\\'ombre\" for Dion\\'s 2007 album D\\'elles. Dion and Angélil became engaged on 30 March 1993, which was Dion\\'s 25th birthday, and made their relationship public in the liner notes of her 1993 album The Colour of My Love. They married on 17 December 1994, at Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal, Quebec. On 5 January 2000, Dion and Angélil renewed their wedding vows in Las Vegas.\\nIn May 2000, Dion had two small operations at a fertility clinic in New York to improve her chances of conceiving, after deciding to use in vitro fertilization because of years of failed attempts to conceive. Their first son, René-Charles Angélil, was born on 25 January 2001. Dion suffered a miscarriage in 2009. In May 2010, Angélil announced that she was 14 weeks pregnant with twins after a sixth treatment of in vitro fertilization. On Saturday, 23 October 2010, at 11:11 and 11:12 am respectively, Dion gave birth to fraternal twins by Caesarean section at St. Mary\\'s Medical Center in West Palm Beach, Florida, The twins were named Eddy, after Dion\\'s favourite French songwriter, Eddy Marnay, who had also produced her first five albums; and Nelson, after former South African President Nelson Mandela. She appeared with her newborn sons on the cover of 9 December 2010 issue of the Canadian edition of Hello! magazine.\\n\\nOn 14 January 2016, Angélil died at age 73 of throat cancer. His funeral was held on 22 January 2016, in Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal, where he and Dion wed 21 years earlier. The couple\\'s eldest son René-Charles gave the eulogy, three days before his 15th birthday. Following Angélil\\'s death, Dion became the sole owner and president of her management and production companies, including CDA Productions and Les Productions Feeling. Two days after Angélil\\'s death—on what would have been her husband\\'s birthday—one of Dion\\'s brothers, Daniel, died at age 59, also of cancer. On 22 March 2018, Dion\\'s management team announced that she had been dealing with hearing irregularities for the previous 12–18 months due to patulous Eustachian tube and would undergo a minimally invasive surgical procedure to correct the problem after ear-drop medications appeared to be no longer working.\\nOwing to her slight frame, Dion has for decades been subject of eating disorder rumors, which she has consistently denied: \"I don\\'t have an eating problem, and there\\'s nothing more I can say about it\". \"My work requires me to be in great physical shape. I wouldn\\'t have been able to give up to a hundred shows a year and travel ceaselessly from one end of the world to the other if I had eaten too much or not enough, or if, as certain magazines have claimed, I made myself throw up after each meal.\" She has often spoken about having been bullied at school and lacking confidence in her early years in the business: \"I didn\\'t have, visually, what it took. I was not pretty, I had teeth problems, and I was very skinny. I didn\\'t fit the mold\". Dion took up ballet under the guidance of her former dancer, Naomi Stikeman, who also previously performed for The National Ballet of Canada and La La La Human Steps, and former Cirque du Soleil dancer-turned-fashion-illustrator, Pepe Muñoz, who is also part of her styling team. She is also a skier and a regular at her son René-Charles\\' hockey games.\\n\\nDion resides in Henderson, Nevada, in a house she bought with her husband in 2003. She previously owned homes in Montreal, Quebec, and Jupiter Island, Florida. Dion\\'s older son René-Charles Angélil loves music and has tried to follow a musical path. Under the stage name Big Tip, he released six rap songs on his SoundCloud account in May 2018 including originals \"The Kid\", \"The Apple\" and \"Never Stop\" and two adaptations from The Weeknd songs, \"Catwalks\" sampling on The Weeknd\\'s \"Sidewalks\" and a remix of The Weeknd\\'s \"Loft Music\" as \"Loft Music Remix\". He also released the 5-track EP CasiNo. 5 in December 2020 using the artistic name RC Angelil. The EP includes the tracks \"Mamba Mentality\", \"Money, Thrills and Rest\", \"No Ls\", \"GG4\" (featuring PAKKA) and \"LV\".\\nIn December 2022, Dion disclosed that she had been diagnosed with stiff-person syndrome, a neurological disorder affecting her muscles.  In June 2024, Dion publicly disclosed in a People magazine cover story that she had struggled with a variety of mysterious symptoms for 17 years before her August 2022 diagnosis.  It was also concurrently revealed that for two years, Dion had been under the care of Dr. Amanda Piquet, a specialist in autoimmune neurology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colorado, and that Dion\\'s charitable foundation was donating $2 million to the Anschutz Medical Campus to support autoimmune neurology research for five years.\\n\\nDiscography\\nConcert tours and residencies\\nTours\\nResidencies\\nA New Day...

              "['Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as Eminem (also stylized as EMINƎM), is an American rapper. He is credited with popularizing hip hop in Middle America and is regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time. His global success is considered to have broken racial barriers to the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him a controversial figure, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as influencing many musical artists. His most popular songs include \"My Name Is\", \"The Real Slim Shady\", \"Stan\", \"Without Me\", \"Lose Yourself\", \"Not Afraid\", \"Love the Way You Lie\", \"The Monster\" and \"Houdini\". After the release of his debut album Infinite (1996) and the extended play Slim Shady EP (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dre Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP. His next two releases, The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and The Eminem Show (2002), were worldwide successes and were nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, the latter becoming the best-selling album worldwide of 2002. After the release of his next album, Encore (2004), Eminem went on hiatus, largely due to a prescription drug addiction. He returned to the music industry with the releases of Relapse (2009) and Recovery (2010), the latter becoming the best-selling album worldwide of 2010. He then released the US number-one albums The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013), Revival (2017), Kamikaze (2018), and Music to Be Murdered By (2020). His twelfth studio album, The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce), was released in July 2024. Eminem was also a member of the hip hop group D12, and has collaborated with fellow Detroit-based rapper Royce da 59\" as the duo Bad Meets Evil. Eminem played a dramatized version of himself in the 2002 musical drama film 8 Mile. \"Lose Yourself\", a song from its soundtrack, topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 12 weeks—the most for a solo rap song—and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, making him the first hip hop artist ever to win the award. He also co-founded Shady Records, which helped launch the careers of artists such as D12, 50 Cent, and Obie Trice, and established his own Sirius XM Radio channel, Shade 45. Eminem is among the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated worldwide sales of over 220 million records. He was the best-selling music artist in the United States for the 2000s, placing third for the 2010s. He was the first artist to have ten albums consecutively debut at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, and has had five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Curtain Call: The Hits (2005), \"Lose Yourself\", \"Love the Way You Lie\", and \"Not Afraid\" have all been certified Diamond or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). He has won numerous awards, including 15 Grammy Awards, eight American Music Awards, 17 Billboard Music Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, and an MTV Europe Music Global Icon Award. Billboard named him the \"Artist of the Decade (2000–2009)\", and Rolling Stone named him one of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\" and \"100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time\". In 2022, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Early life Marshall Bruce Mathers III was born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri, the only child of Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr. and Deborah Rae \"Debbie\" (née Nelson). His mother nearly died during her 73-hour labor with him. Eminem parents were in a band called Daddy Warbucks, playing in Ramada Inns along the Dakotas–Montana border before they separated. His father abandoned his family when Eminem was a year and a half old, and Eminem was raised only by his mother, Debbie, in poverty. He wrote letters to his father, but Debbie said that they all came back marked \"return to sender\". His mother later had a son named Nathan \"Nate\" Kane Samara.  By age of twelve, Eminem and his mother shuttled between states, rarely staying in one house for more than a year or two and mostly living with family members, moved several times and lived in several towns and cities in Missouri (including St. Joseph, Savannah, and Kansas City) and Metro Detroit (Warren and Roseville) before settling in the city of Detroit. For much of his youth, Eminem and his mother lived in a working-class, primarily black, Detroit neighborhood. He and Debbie were one of three white households on their block, and Eminem was beaten several times by black youths. Eminem frequently fought with his mother, whom a social worker described as her having a \"very suspicious, almost paranoid personality\". When he was a child, a bully named DAngelo Bailey severely injured Eminem head in an assault, an incident which Eminem later recounted (with comic exaggeration) on the song \"Brain Damage\". Debbie filed a lawsuit against the public school for this in 1982. The suit was dismissed the following year by a Macomb County, Michigan, judge, who said the schools were immune from lawsuits. Eminem was interested in storytelling, aspiring to be a comic book artist before discovering hip hop. He heard his first rap song (\"Reckless\", featuring Ice-T) on the Breakin soundtrack, a gift from Debbie half-brother, Ronnie Polkingharn. His uncle was close to the boy and later became a musical mentor to him. When Polkingharn committed suicide in 1991, Eminem stopped speaking publicly for days and did not attend his funeral. At age 14, Eminem began rapping with high-school friend Mike Ruby; they adopted the names \"Manix\" and \"M&M\", the latter evolving into \"Eminem\". Eminem snuck into neighboring Osborn High School with friend and fellow rapper Proof for lunchroom freestyle rap battles. On Saturdays, they attended open mic contests at the Hip-Hop Shop on West 7 Mile Road, considered \"ground zero\" for the Detroit rap scene. Struggling to succeed in a predominantly black industry, Eminem was appreciated by underground hip hop audiences. When he wrote verses, he wanted most of the words to rhyme; he wrote long words or phrases on paper and, underneath, worked on rhymes for each syllable. Although the words often made little sense, the drill helped Eminem practice sounds and rhymes. In 1987, Debbie allowed runaway Kimberly Anne \"Kim\" Scott to stay at their home. Several years later, Eminem began an on-and-off relationship with Scott. After spending three years in ninth grade due to truancy and poor grades, he dropped out of Lincoln High School at age 17. Although interested in English, Eminem never explored literature (preferring comic books) and he disliked math and social studies. Eminem worked at several jobs to help his mother pay the bills. One of the jobs he had was with Little Caesar Pizza in Warren. He later said she often threw him out of the house anyway, often after taking most of his paycheck. When she left to play bingo, he would blast the stereo and write songs.  Music career 1988–1997: early career, Infinite and family struggles In 1988, he went by the stage name MC Double M and formed his first group, New Jacks, and made a self-titled demo tape with DJ Butter Fingers. In 1989, they later joined Bassmint Productions who later changed their name to Soul Intent in 1992 with rapper Proof and other childhood friends. They released a self-titled EP in 1995 featuring Proof. Eminem also made his first music video appearance in 1992 in a song titled, \"Do-Da-Dippity\", by Champtown. Later in 1996, Eminem and Proof teamed up with four other rappers to form The Dirty Dozen (D12), who released The Underground E.P. in 1997 and their first album Devil Night in 2001. He was also affiliated with Newark rap collective Outsidaz, collaborating with them on different projects. Eminem was soon signed to Jeff and Mark Bass F.B.T. Productions and recorded his debut album Infinite for their independent Web Entertainment label. The album was a commercial failure upon its release in 1996. One lyrical subject of Infinite was his struggle to raise his newborn daughter, Hailie Jade Scott Mathers, on little money. During this period, Eminem rhyming style, primarily inspired by rappers Nas, Esham and AZ, lacked the comically violent slant for which he later became known. Detroit disc jockeys largely ignored Infinite and the feedback Eminem did receive (\"Why dont you go into rock and roll?\") led him to craft angrier, moodier tracks. At this time Eminem and Kim Scott lived in a crime-ridden neighborhood and their house was robbed several times. Eminem cooked and washed dishes for minimum wage at Gilbert Lodge, a family-style restaurant at St. Clair Shores. His former boss described him as becoming a model employee, as he worked 60 hours a week for six months after Hailie birth. He was fired shortly before Christmas and later said, \"It was, like, five days before Christmas, which is Hailie birthday. I had, like, forty dollars to get her something.\" After the release of Infinite, his personal problems and substance abuse culminated in a suicide attempt. By March 1997 he was fired from Gilbert Lodge for the last time and lived in his mother mobile home with Kim and Hailie.  1997–1999: introduction of Slim Shady, The Slim Shady LP and rise to success Eminem attracted more attention when he developed Slim Shady, a sadistic, violent alter ego. The character allowed him to express his anger with lyrics about drugs, rape and murder. In the spring of 1997 he recorded his debut EP, the Slim Shady EP, which was released that winter by Web Entertainment. The EP, with frequent references to drug use, sexual acts, mental instability and violence, also explored the more-serious themes of dealing with poverty and marital and family difficulties and revealed his direct, self-deprecating response to criticism. Hip hop magazine The Source featured Eminem in its \"Unsigned Hype\" column in March 1998. After he was fired from his job and evicted from his home, Eminem went to Los Angeles to compete in the 1997 Rap Olympics, a nationwide battle rap competition. He placed second, losing to Project Blowed MC Otherwize. An Interscope Records intern named Dean Geistlinger was in attendance and asked Eminem for a copy of the Slim Shady EP, which was then sent to company CEO Jimmy Iovine. Iovine played the tape for record producer Dr. Dre, founder of Aftermath Entertainment and founding member of hip hop group N.W.A. Dre recalled, \"In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, Find him. Now.\" Dre would later state on the fourth and last episode of The Defiant Ones, \"I was like: what the fuck!?, and who the fuck is that?\" expressing his shock towards Mathers rapping talent. Although his associates criticized him for hiring a white rapper, Dre was confident in his decision: \"I dont give a fuck if youre purple; if you can kick it, Im working with you.\" Eminem had idolized Dre since listening to N.W.A as a teenager and was nervous about working with him on an album: \"I didnt want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much ... Im just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars let alone Dr. Dre.\" He became more comfortable working with Dre after a series of productive recording sessions. Eminem released The Slim Shady LP in February 1999. Although it was one of the year most popular albums (certified triple platinum by the end of the year), he was accused of imitating the style and subject matter of underground rapper Cage. The album popularity was accompanied by controversy over its lyrics; in \"97 Bonnie & Clyde\" Eminem describes a trip with his infant daughter when he disposes of his wife body and in \"Guilty Conscience\" which encourages a man to murder his wife and her lover. \"Guilty Conscience\" marked the beginning of a friendship and musical bond between Dr. Dre and Eminem. The label-mates later collaborated on a number of hit songs (\"Forgot About Dre\" and \"What the Difference\" while also providing uncredited vocals on \"The Watcher\" from Dr. Dre album 2001, \"Bitch Please II\" from The Marshall Mathers LP, \"Say What You Say\" from The Eminem Show, \"Encore/Curtains Down\" from Encore and \"Old Time Sake\" and \"Crack a Bottle\" from Relapse) and Dre made at least one guest appearance on each of Eminem Aftermath albums. The Slim Shady LP has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA.  1999–2003: The Marshall Mathers LP and The Eminem Show After Eminem released The Slim Shady LP, he started his own record label, Shady Records, in late 1999. Eminem looked for an avenue to release D12, and his manager Paul Rosenberg was keen to start a label, which led to the two teaming up to form Shady. Its A&R Marc Labelle has defined the record label as \"a boutique label but [with] all the outlets of a major [and] Interscope backing up our every move.\" Recorded from 1999 to 2000, The Marshall Mathers LP was released in May 2000. It sold 1.76 million copies in its first week, breaking US records held by Snoop Dogg Doggystyle for fastest-selling hip hop album and Britney Spears ...Baby One More Time for fastest-selling solo album. The first single from the album, \"The Real Slim Shady\", was a success despite controversies about Eminem insults and dubious claims about celebrities (for example, that Christina Aguilera had performed oral sex on Carson Daly and Fred Durst). In his second single, \"The Way I Am\", he reveals the pressure from his record company to top \"My Name Is\". Although Eminem parodied shock rocker Marilyn Manson in the music video for \"My Name Is\", they are reportedly on good terms; Manson is mentioned in \"The Way I Am\", appeared in its music video and has performed a live remix of the song with Eminem. In the third single, \"Stan\" (which samples Dido \"Thank You\"), Eminem tries to deal with his new fame, assuming the persona of a deranged fan who kills himself and his pregnant girlfriend (mirroring \"97 Bonnie & Clyde\" from The Slim Shady LP). The music magazine Q called \"Stan\" the third-greatest rap song ever, and it was ranked tenth in a Top40-Charts.com survey. The song has since been ranked 296th on Rolling Stone \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list. In July 2000, Eminem was the first white artist to appear on the cover of The Source. The Marshall Mathers LP was certified Diamond by the RIAA in March 2011 and sold 21 million copies worldwide. In 2000 Eminem also appeared in the Up in Smoke Tour with rappers Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit and Ice Cube and the Family Values Tour with Limp Bizkit, headlining the Anger Management Tour with Papa Roach, Ludacris and Xzibit. Eminem performed with Elton John at the 43rd Grammy Awards ceremony in 2001, with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD, an organization which considered Eminem lyrics homophobic) condemning John decision to perform with Eminem. Entertainment Weekly placed the appearance on its end-of-decade \"best-of\" list: \"It was the hug heard round the world. Eminem, under fire for homophobic lyrics, shared the stage with a gay icon for a performance of Stan that would have been memorable in any context.\" On February 21, the day of the awards ceremony, GLAAD held a protest outside the Staples Center (the ceremony venue). Eminem was also the only guest artist to appear on fellow rapper Jay-Z critically acclaimed album The Blueprint, producing and rapping on the song \"Renegade\". The Eminem Show was released in May 2002. It was another success, reaching number one on the charts and selling over 1.332 million copies during its first full week. The album single, \"Without Me\", denigrates boy bands, Limp Bizkit, Dick and Lynne Cheney, Moby and others. The Eminem Show, certified Diamond by the RIAA, examines the effects of Eminem rise to fame, his relationship with his wife and daughter and his status in the hip hop community, addressing an assault charge brought by a bouncer he saw kissing his wife in 2000. Although several tracks are clearly angry, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found The Eminem Show less inflammatory than The Marshall Mathers LP. L. Brent Bozell III, who had criticized The Marshall Mathers LP for misogynistic lyrics, noted The Eminem Show extensive use of obscenity and called Eminem \"Eminef\" for the prevalence of the word \"motherfucker\" on the album. The Eminem Show sold 27 million copies worldwide and was the bestselling album of 2002.  2003–2007: production work, Encore and musical hiatus In 2003, Eminem, a lifelong fan of Tupac, provided production work for three tracks on the Tupac Resurrection soundtrack. He would follow this up the next year by producing 12 of the 16 tracks on Tupac Loyal to the Game album. On December 8, 2003, the United States Secret Service said that it was \"looking into\" allegations that Eminem had threatened the President of the United States. The cause for concern was the lyrics of \"We As Americans\" (\"Fuck money / I dont rap for dead presidents / Id rather see the president dead / It never been said, but I set precedents\"), which was later released on a bonus CD with the deluxe edition of Encore. Encore, released in 2004, was another success, but not as successful as his previous albums. Its sales were partially driven by the first single, \"Just Lose It\", which contained slurs directed toward Michael Jackson. On October 12, 2004, a week after the release of \"Just Lose It\", Jackson phoned Steve Harvey radio show, The Steve Harvey Morning Show, to report his displeasure with its video (which parodies Jackson child molestation trial, plastic surgery and the 1984 incident when Jackson hair caught fire during the filming of a commercial). In the song, Eminem says, \"That not a stab at Michael / That just a metaphor / Im just psycho.\" Many of Jackson friends and supporters spoke out against the video, including Stevie Wonder, who described it as \"kicking a man while he down\" and \"bullshit\", and Steve Harvey (who said, \"Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back\"). The video also parodied Pee-wee Herman, MC Hammer and Madonna during her Blond Ambition period. \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, who parodied the Eminem song \"Lose Yourself\" on \"Couch Potato\" for his 2003 album Poodle Hat, told the Chicago Sun-Times about Jackson protest: \"Last year, Eminem forced me to halt production on the video for my Lose Yourself parody because he somehow thought that it would be harmful to his image or career. So the irony of this situation with Michael is not lost on me.\" Although Black Entertainment Television stopped playing the video, MTV announced that it would continue to air it. The Source, through CEO Raymond \"Benzino\" Scott, called for the video to be pulled, the song removed from the album and Eminem to apologize publicly to Jackson. In 2007, Jackson and Sony bought Famous Music from Viacom, giving him the rights to songs by Eminem, Shakira, Beck and others. Despite its lead single humorous theme, Encore explored serious subject matter with the anti-war song \"Mosh\", which criticized President George W. Bush as \"This weapon of mass destruction that we call our president\", with lyrics including \"Fuck Bush.\" On October 25, 2004, a week before the 2004 US Presidential election, Eminem released the video for \"Mosh\" on the Internet. In it, Eminem gathers an army (including rapper Lloyd Banks) of Bush-administration victims and leads them to the White House. When they break in, it is learned that they are there to register to vote; the video ends with \"VOTE Tuesday November 2.\" After Bush reelection, the video ending was changed to Eminem and the protesters invading the White House during a speech by the president. Also in 2004 Eminem launched a satellite music channel, Shade 45, on Sirius radio, which was described by his manager as \"essentially a destination to get and hear things that other people arent playing.\" Eminem began his first US concert tour in three years in the summer of 2005 with the Anger Management 3 Tour, featuring 50 Cent, G-Unit, Lil Jon, D12, Obie Trice and the Alchemist, but in August, Eminem canceled the European leg of the tour, later announcing that he had entered drug rehabilitation for treatment of a \"dependency on sleep medication\". Meanwhile, industry insiders speculated that Eminem was considering retirement, while rumors circulated that a double album titled The Funeral would be released. In July, the Detroit Free Press reported a possible final bow for Eminem as a solo performer, quoting members of his inner circle as saying that he would embrace the roles of producer and label executive. A greatest hits album, Curtain Call: The Hits, was released on December 6, 2005, by Aftermath Entertainment, and sold nearly 441,000 copies in the US in its first week, marking Eminem fourth consecutive number-one album on the Billboard Hot 200, and was certified double platinum by the RIAA. However, Eminem suggested that month on WKQI \"Mojo in the Morning\" show that he would be taking a break as an artist: \"Im at a point in my life right now where I feel like I dont know where my career is going ... This is the reason that we called it Curtain Call because this could be the final thing. We dont know.\"  In April 2006, Proof, who was Eminem childhood friend, was murdered. Eight months later, Eminem released a compilation album titled Eminem Presents: The Re-Up that featured Proof and other Shady Records artists.  2007–2009: comeback and Relapse In September 2007, Eminem called New York radio station WQHT during an interview with 50 Cent, saying that he was \"in limbo\" and \"debating\" about when (or if) he would release another album: \"Im always working—Im always in the studio. It feels good right now, the energy of the label. For a while, I didnt want to go back to the studio ... I went through some personal things. Im coming out of those personal things [and] it feels good.\" Eminem appeared on his Shade 45 Sirius channel in September 2008, saying: \"Right now Im kinda just concentrating on my own stuff, for right now and just banging out tracks and producing a lot of stuff. You know, the more I keep producing the better it seems like I get cause I just start knowing stuff.\" Interscope confirmed that a new album would be released in spring 2009. In December 2008, Eminem provided more details about the album, entitled Relapse: \"Me and Dre are back in the lab like the old days, man. Dre will end up producing the majority of the tracks on Relapse. We are up to our old mischievous ways ... let just leave it at that.\" According to a March 5, 2009, press release, Eminem would release two new albums that year. Relapse, the first, was released on May 19; its first single and music video, \"We Made You\", had been released on April 7. Although Relapse did not sell as well as Eminem previous albums and received mixed reviews, it was a commercial success and re-established his presence in the hip hop world. It sold more than five million copies worldwide. On October 30 he headlined at the Voodoo Experience in New Orleans, his first full performance of the year. Eminem act included several songs from Relapse, many of his older hits and an appearance by D12. On November 19, he announced on his website that Relapse: Refill would be released on December 21. The album was a re-release of Relapse with seven bonus tracks, including \"Forever\" and \"Taking My Ball\". Eminem described the CD:  I want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned ... Hopefully, these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until we put out Relapse 2 next year ... I got back in with Dre and then a few more producers, including Just Blaze, and went in a completely different direction which made me start from scratch. The new tracks started to sound very different than the tracks I originally intended to be on Relapse 2, but I still want the other stuff to be heard.  2009–2011: Recovery and Bad Meets Evil reunion On April 14, 2010, Eminem tweeted: \"There is no Relapse 2\". Although his followers thought he was not releasing an album, he had changed its title to Recovery and confirmed this by tweeting \"Recovery\" with a link to his website. He said:  I had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title. Recorded from 2009 to 2010, Recovery was released on June 18. In the US, Recovery sold 741,000 copies during its first week, topping the Billboard 200 chart. Eminem sixth consecutive US number-one album also topped the charts in several other countries. Recovery remained atop the Billboard 200 chart for five consecutive weeks of a seven-week total. Billboard reported that it was the bestselling album of 2010, making Eminem the first artist in Nielsen SoundScan history with two year-end bestselling albums. Recovery is the bestselling digital album in history. Its first single, \"Not Afraid\", was released on April 29 and debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100; its music video was released on June 4. \"Not Afraid\" was followed by \"Love the Way You Lie\", which debuted at number two before rising to the top. Although \"Love the Way You Lie\" was the bestselling 2010 single in the United Kingdom, it did not reach number one (the first time this has happened in the UK since 1969). Despite criticism of its inconsistency, Recovery received positive reviews from most critics. As of November 21, 2010, the album had US sales of three million copies. Recovery was the bestselling album worldwide in 2010, joining 2002 bestseller The Eminem Show to give Eminem two worldwide year-end number-one albums. With Recovery, Eminem broke the record for the most successive US number-one albums by a solo artist. He appeared at the 2010 BET Awards, performing \"Not Afraid\" and \"Airplanes, Part II\" with B.o.B and Keyshia Cole. Later that year, he performed at the Activison E3 concert. In June, Eminem and Jay-Z announced they would perform together in Detroit and New York City, at concerts called The Home & Home Tour. The first two concerts quickly sold out, prompting an additional show in each city. BET called Eminem the number-one rapper of the 21st century. He opened the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, performing \"Not Afraid\" and \"Love the Way You Lie\" with Rihanna singing the choruses. Due to the success of Recovery and the Home & Home Tour, Eminem was named the 2010 Hottest MC in the Game by MTV and Emcee of the Year by the online magazine HipHopDX. He and Rihanna again collaborated on \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\", the sequel of their hit single. Unlike the original, Rihanna is the lead vocalist and it is sung from the female perspective. In December 2010, the \"Great Eminem Recovery\" was number one on Billboard Top 25 Music Moments of 2010. He appeared at the 2011 Grammy Awards on February 13, performing \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\" with Rihanna and Adam Levine and \"I Need a Doctor\" with Dr. Dre and Skylar Grey.

In March 2011, within days of each other, The Eminem Show and The Marshall Mathers LP were certified diamond by the RIAA; Eminem is the only rapper with two diamond-certified albums. With more than 60 million \"likes\" he was the most-followed person on Facebook, outscoring Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Rihanna and Michael Jackson. Eminem was the first artist in five years with two number-one albums (Recovery and Hell: The Sequel) in a 12-month period.

On August 14, \"Survival\", featuring Liz Rodrigues and produced by DJ Khalil, premiered in the multi-player trailer for the video game Call of Duty: Ghosts.

In the song, Eminem calls the newly elected President Donald Trump a \"bitch\" and also raps about raping conservative social and political commentator Ann Coulter, who is a Trump supporter, with a variety of foreign objects. Coulter responded to the lyrics, stating, \"I think it unfortunate that the left, from Berkeley to Eminem with his rap songs, has normalized violence against women, as Eminem has done.\" Eminem participated in the 2017 BET Hip Hop Awards annual cypher, using his verse, a freestyle rap called \"The Storm\", to further criticize Trump and the administration for, among other things, Trump focus on National Football League players protests during \"The Star Spangled Banner\" over Hurricane Maria recovery efforts and lack of gun control reform in the wake of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. Eminem ended the cypher by giving an ultimatum saying that Trump supporters cannot be his fans. The verse received wide praise among other rappers following its release. In October 2017, Eminem appeared on \"Revenge\", a track from Pink album Beautiful Trauma. It was reported that the Secret Service interviewed Eminem in 2018–2019, regarding threatening lyrics towards President Trump and daughter Ivanka. Starting in late October 2017, Eminem and Paul Rosenberg began teasing what fans speculated was the title of a new album titled Revival, in the form of advertisements for a fake medication of the same name. Later in November, the first single \"Walk on Water\" was released, which featured Beyoncé. The song was first performed, by Eminem, at the 2017 MTV Europe Music Awards on November 12, featuring Skylar Grey. He appeared on Saturday Night Live on November 18, performing \"Walk on Water\", \"Stan\" and \"Love the Way You Lie\" with Skylar Grey.

Despite an online leak of the album two days prior, Revival was released as planned on December 15. On January 5, 2018, the second single \"River\" was released, which featured Ed Sheeran. It became Eminem eighth consecutive album to top the US Billboard 200 upon release with 197,000 copies sold in its first week. As a result, he became the first musical act to have eight entries in a row debut atop the chart. The album was met with mixed reviews from music critics and is generally considered his worst album. In 2018, an extended edition of \"Nowhere Fast\" with Kehlani and a remix of \"Chloraseptic\" featuring 2 Chainz and Phresher were released from Revival. On August 31, 2018, Eminem released his tenth studio album and first surprise album Kamikaze, making it his second full-length studio album in 8 months.

Subsequently, Eminem became the first artist to have ten consecutive albums debut at number one in the US and one of six artists to have released at least ten US number-one albums. Music critics praised Eminem lyrical abilities and the improved production after Kamikaze, while criticism directed towards the album formulaic song structure, lack of innovation and shock value. The lyrics of \"Unaccommodating\", in which Eminem referenced the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, drew significant criticism, with many critics finding the lyrics objectionable. The mayor of Manchester denounced the song lyrics, describing them as \"unnecessarily hurtful and deeply disrespectful\".

The disses are a response to Benzino track \"Rap Elvis\". During an episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! on March 19, 2024, Dr. Dre stated that Eminem intended to release a new album that year. On April 25, Eminem appeared alongside Roger Goodell at the opening ceremony of the 2024 NFL draft in Detroit. At the same time, Eminem announced a twelfth studio album titled The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce), with a planned release later in the year. The trailer for the album, which was shown on the NFL Network, briefly discusses the \"murder\" of the Slim Shady persona in a true crime format. 50 Cent is also featured in a cameo role. The album is produced by Dr. Dre and The ICU. On May 28, 2024, the rapper posted a joint Instagram video with magician David Blaine.

The song released on July 2, with an accompanying music video produced by Cole Bennett to follow on July 5. The track title is a reference to actor Tobey Maguire, best known for his role in the Spider-Man films. The single art is also a reference to the iconic \"3 spiderman pointing\" meme.  Artistry Influences, style and rapping technique Eminem has cited several MCs as influencing his rapping style, including Esham, Kool G Rap, Masta Ace, Big Daddy Kane, Tupac Shakur, Newcleus, Ice-T, Mantronix, Melle Mel (on \"The Message\"), LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, Run-D.M.C., Rakim and Boogie Down Productions. In How to Rap, Guerilla Black notes that Eminem studied other MCs to hone his rapping technique: \"Eminem listened to everything and that what made him one of the greats\". In the book, other MCs also praise aspects of his rapping technique: varied, humorous subject matter, connecting with his audience, carrying a concept over a series of albums, complex rhyme schemes, bending words so they rhyme, multisyllabic rhymes, many rhymes to a bar, complex rhythms, clear enunciation, and the use of melody and syncopation. Eminem is known to write most of his lyrics on paper (documented in The Way I Am), taking several days or a week to craft lyrics, being a \"workaholic\" and \"stacking\" vocals. Examples of hip hop subgenres that Eminem music has been described as include horrorcore, comedy hip hop, and hardcore hip hop. Eminem also incorporates rap rock into his music and has cited rock acts during the 1970s and 1980s, such as Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin, as influences in his music.  Alter egos Eminem uses alter egos in his songs for different rapping styles and subject matter. His best-known alter ego, Slim Shady, first appeared on the Slim Shady EP and was in The Slim Shady LP, The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Encore, Relapse, The Marshall Mathers LP 2, Kamikaze and Music to Be Murdered By. In this persona, his songs are violent and dark, with a comic twist. Eminem downplayed Slim Shady on Recovery because he felt it did not fit the album theme. The end of the character is suggested to be with The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce) LP in 2024. Another character is Ken Kaniff, a gay man who pokes fun at Eminem songs. Ken was created and originally played by fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle on the Slim Shady LP, where Kaniff makes a prank call to Eminem. An argument after the album release prompted Eminem to use the Kaniff character on Marshall Mathers and later albums (except Encore and Recovery). Aristotle, angry with Eminem use of his character, released a mixtape in his Kaniff persona ridiculing him.  Collaborations and productions Although Eminem usually collaborates with Aftermath Entertainment and Shady Records rappers such as Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, D12, Obie Trice and Yelawolf, he has also worked with Redman, Kid Rock, DMX, Lil Wayne, Missy Elliott, Jay Z, Drake, Rihanna, Nas, Nicki Minaj, Xzibit, Method Man, Jadakiss, Fat Joe, Sticky Fingaz, T.I. and Young Jeezy. Eminem rapped a verse in a live performance of Busta Rhymes \"Touch It\" remix at the 2006 BET Music Awards. He appeared on Akon single \"Smack That\" from Konvicted, Lil Wayne hit \"Drop the World\" and \"My Life\" (the lead single from 50 Cent Street King Immortal). Eminem was the executive producer of D12 first two albums (Devil Night and D12 World), Obie Trice Cheers and Second Round on Me and 50 Cent Get Rich or Die Tryin and The Massacre. He has produced songs for other rappers such as Jadakiss \"Welcome To D-Block\", Jay-Z \"Renegade\" and \"Moment of Clarity\", Lloyd Banks \"On Fire\", \"Warrior Part 2\" and \"Hands Up\", Tony Yayo \"Drama Setter\", Trick-Trick \"Welcome 2 Detroit\" and Xzibit \"My Name\" and \"Dont Approach Me\". Most of The Eminem Show was produced by Eminem and his longtime collaborator, Jeff Bass, and Eminem co-produced Encore with Dr. Dre. In 2004, Eminem was co-executive producer of 2Pac posthumous album Loyal to the Game with Shakur mother, Afeni. He produced the UK number-one single \"Ghetto Gospel\", featuring Elton John; \"The Cross\", from the Nas album God Son; and eight tracks on Obie Trice 2006 album Second Round on Me (also appearing on \"There They Go\"). Eminem produced several tracks on Trick-Trick The Villain (appearing on \"Who Want It\") and produced four tracks on Cashis 2013 album The County Hound 2. Eminem has only produced for and appeared on one track with former Aftermath/Interscope labelmate The Game; \"We Aint\" (a track from Game January 2005 debut album, The Documentary). In 2022, Game would later release a ten-minute diss track towards Eminem titled \"The Black Slim Shady\". Eminem is considered unusual in structuring his songs around the lyrics, rather than writing to beats. One exception was \"Stan\", which came from an idea and scratch track produced by the 45 King. After doing little production on Relapse and Recovery, Eminem produced a significant portion of The Marshall Mathers LP 2. He said about producing his own music, \"Sometimes, I may get something in my head, like an idea or the mood of something that I would want, and Im not always gonna get that by going through different tracks that other people have made. They dont know what in my head. I think maybe it helps, a little bit, with diversity, the sound of it, but also, I would get something in my head and want to be able to lay down that idea from scratch.\" In 1998 when his beef with rapper Cage was still happening, New York rapper Necro (who had previously produced three songs for Cage) met Eminem and gave him a CD with the beat to what eventually became the beat for the song \"Black Helicopters\" by rap group Non-Phixion. Despite Eminem never using it, Necro still said positive things about Eminem and would appear on Shade45 years later.  Comparisons with other artists As a white performer prominent in a genre influenced by black artists, Eminem has been compared, much to his chagrin, to Elvis Presley, and has lyrically been compared to Bob Dylan. Rapper Asher Roth has been compared to Eminem and Roth devoted a song on his album (\"As I Em\") to him, which Eminem took offense to. The accomplished trumpeter Nicholas Payton has called Eminem \"the Bix Beiderbecke of hip hop\".  Other ventures Shady Records Following Eminem multiplatinum record sales, Interscope offered him his own label; he and Paul Rosenberg founded Shady Records in late 1999. Eminem signed his Detroit collective, D12 and rapper Obie Trice to the label and signed 50 Cent in a 2002 joint venture with Dr. Dre Aftermath label. In 2003, Eminem and Dr. Dre added Atlanta rapper Stat Quo to the Shady-Aftermath roster. DJ Green Lantern, Eminem former DJ, was with Shady Records until a dispute related to the 50 Cent-Jadakiss feud forced him to leave the label. The Alchemist is currently Eminem tour DJ. In 2005 Eminem signed another Atlanta rapper, Bobby Creekwater and West Coast rapper Cashis to Shady Records. On December 5, 2006, the compilation album Eminem Presents: The Re-Up was released on Shady Records. The project began as a mixtape, but when Eminem found the material better than expected he released it as an album. The Re-Up was intended to introduce Stat Quo, Cashis and Bobby Creekwater. While he was recording Infinite, Eminem, Proof and Kon Artis assembled a group of fellow rappers now known as D12, short for \"Detroit Twelve\" or \"Dirty Dozen\", who performed in a style similar to Wu-Tang Clan. In 2001 D12 debut album, Devil Night, was released. The first single from the album was \"Shit on You\", followed by \"Purple Pills\" (an ode to recreational drug use) and \"Fight Music\". \"Purple Pills\" was rewritten for radio and television, removing many of the song references to drugs and sex and renamed \"Purple Hills\". After their debut, D12 took a three-year break from the studio. They reunited in 2004 for their second album, D12 World, which included the hit singles \"My Band\" and \"How Come\". \"American Psycho 2\" featuring Cypress Hill member, B-Real, was another popular hit. According to D12 member Bizarre, Eminem was not featured on his album Blue Cheese & Coney Island because \"he busy doing his thing\". In January 2014, Bass Brothers announced that D12 had returned to record at F.B.T. Studio and they were working on an album with Eminem on at least three songs. Bizarre reported that he was still part of the group and that the album was scheduled for a 2014 release.  Shade 45 Eminem established his own satellite radio channel, Shade 45, that plays uncut hip hop. Eminem also established a new morning show, Sway in the Morning with Sway Calloway, a lively morning show that airs at 8:00 a.m., Monday–Friday. Eminem promoted the station in a 2004 mock national convention (the \"Shady National Convention\") at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City, in which Donald Trump endorsed him. On his album Revival (2017), Eminem expressed his regret at having collaborated with Trump, rapping, \"wish I would have spit on it before I went to shake his hand at the event\".  Mom Spaghetti Restaurant On September 29, 2021, Eminem and Union Joints opened a spaghetti restaurant at 2131 Woodward Ave in Detroit. It is a reference to the lyrics \"His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy / There vomit on his sweater already, mom spaghetti\" from the song \"Lose Yourself\" which became an internet meme. Mom Spaghetti was previously a pop-up in Detroit in 2017 and at Coachella in 2018. In 2023, Eminem announced the launch of a \"Mom Spaghetti\" jarred pasta sauce.  Acting career After small roles in the 2001 film The Wash and as an extra in the 1998 Korn music video for \"Got the Life\" (during which he gave the band a demo tape), Eminem made his Hollywood debut in the semi-autobiographical 2002 film 8 Mile. He said it was a representation of growing up in Detroit rather than an account of his life. He recorded several new songs for the soundtrack, including \"Lose Yourself\" (which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2003 and became the longest-running No. 1 hip hop single in history). Eminem was absent from the ceremony and co-composer Luis Resto accepted the award. Eminem voiced an aging, corrupt, AAVE-speaking police officer in the video game 50 Cent: Bulletproof and guested on the Comedy Central television show Crank Yankers and a Web cartoon, The Slim Shady Show He was signed to star in an unmade film version of Have Gun – Will Travel, and was considered for the role of David Rice in the 2008 film Jumper. Eminem had a cameo appearance, arguing with Ray Romano, in the 2009 film Funny People. In a 2010 interview with Jonathan Ross, he stated \"You know, I love music so much. This is my passion, this is what I want to do. Not saying that I wont do a movie ever again, but this is me.\" He played himself in the Entourage season-seven finale \"Lose Yourself\" with Christina Aguilera. Although Eminem was offered the lead role in the 2013 science-fiction film Elysium, he turned it down because director Neill Blomkamp would not change its location from Los Angeles to Detroit. Eminem had a cameo appearance as himself in the 2014 film The Interview. During an interview with the main character, Dave Skylark (James Franco), Eminem satirically comes out as gay.  Charity work Eminem established the Marshall Mathers Foundation to aid disadvantaged youth. The foundation works in conjunction with a charity founded by Norman Yatooma, a Detroit attorney. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Eminem donated a pair of Air Jordan 4 Retro Eminem Carhartt shoes, which are rare, to be raffled off with proceeds going to COVID-19 relief. That same year, he donated \"mom spaghetti\", a reference to a line in his song \"Lose Yourself\", to healthcare workers at Henry Ford Health System in Detroit.  Advertising Eminem appeared in two commercials which were shown during Super Bowl XLV. In the first, a one-minute spot for Lipton Brisk iced tea, he is a claymation figure. In the second, a two-minute ad—the longest in Super Bowl history at the time—for the Chrysler 200, Eminem drives through Detroit (with \"Lose Yourself\" as the soundtrack) to his show at the Fox Theatre.  Books and memoirs On November 21, 2000, Eminem published Angry Blonde, a non-fiction book featuring a commentary of several of his own songs, along with several previously unpublished photographs. On October 21, 2008, his autobiography The Way I Am was published. The book was first published on October 21, 2008, by Dutton Adult. It is a collection of Eminem personal stories, reflections, photographs, original artwork, and original lyric sheets from \"Stan\" and \"The Real Slim Shady\". It details his struggles with poverty, drugs, fame, heartbreak, family and depression, along with stories about his rise to fame and commentary on past controversies. The book is illustrated with never before published photos of Eminem life. It also contains original drawings, previously unpublished lyric sheets, and other rare memorabilia. The autobiography is named after his 2000 song \"The Way I Am\". An autobiography of Eminem mother (My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem) was published the following month, in which Debbie Nelson describes her childhood and adolescence, meeting Eminem father and her son rise to (and struggles with) fame.  Personal life Family and relationships He was twice married to Kimberly Anne Scott; he met Scott in high school while he stood on a table with his shirt off rapping LL Cool J \"Im Bad\". Scott and her twin sister had run away from home; they moved in with Eminem and his mother when he was 15 and he began an on-and-off relationship with Scott in January 14, 1991. Their daughter Hailie Jade, who is Mathers only biological child, was born on December 25, 1995. Mathers and Scott were married in June 14, 1999, and divorced in October 12, 2001. Although Eminem told Rolling Stone in 2002, \"I would rather have a baby through my penis than get married again\", he and Scott briefly remarried in January 14, 2006. He filed for divorce in early April, agreeing to joint custody of Hailie and finalize divorce  on December 18, 2006 In early 2010, Eminem denied tabloid reports that he and Scott had renewed their romantic relationship; however, in the same statement, his representative also confirmed that they now maintain a friendly relationship. Their daughter, Hailie, is a social media influencer, specifically for fashion and beauty. She married her long-term partner Evan McClintock on May 20, 2024, with Eminem, Dr. Dre and 50 Cent among those in attendance. Eminem legally adopted and was given custody of his sister-in-law daughter Alaina Marie, as well as Scott child from an affair, Stevie Laine. He also raised his younger half-brother Nathan. Eminem and actress Brittany Murphy dated in the 2000s. He stated in 2002 that he had been dating singer Mariah Carey, though she later denied it. In 2005, he played alleged voicemails of her during the Anger Management Tour and stated in 2006 that he had dated her for six to seven months, but the two broke up due to the differences in their personalities. In his 2013 song \"Headlights\", Eminem reiterated his love for his mother and apologized to her for some of the lyrics from his songs, with \"Cleanin Out My Closet\" being specifically named.  Health problems Eminem has spoken publicly about his addiction to prescription drugs, including Vicodin, Ambien and Valium. According to friend and fellow D12 member Proof, Eminem first straightened out in 2002. During the production of 8 Mile, Eminem, working 16 hours a day, developed insomnia. An associate gave him an Ambien tablet which \"knocked [him] out\", encouraging him to obtain a prescription. This was Eminem first experience of drug addiction, which would affect him for several years. Near the end of production on Encore, he would \"just go into the studio and goof off [with] a pocketful of pills\". Eminem began taking the drugs to \"feel normal\", taking a \"ridiculous amount ... I could consume anywhere from 40 to 60 Valium [in a day]. Vicodin, maybe 30.\" The drugs would put him to sleep for no more than two hours, after which he would take more. Eminem weight increased to 230 pounds (100 kg) and he was regularly eating fast food: \"The kids behind the counter knew me—it wouldnt even faze them. Or Id sit up at Denny or Big Boy and just eat by myself. It was sad.\" Eminem became less recognizable due to his weight gain and once overheard two teenagers arguing about whether or not it was him: \"Eminem aint fat.\"  In December 2007, Eminem was hospitalized after a methadone overdose. He had first bought from a dealer who had told him it was \"just like Vicodin, and easier on [your] liver\". He continued to buy more until he collapsed in his bathroom one night and was rushed to the hospital. Doctors there told him he had ingested the equivalent of four bags of heroin and was \"about two hours from dying\". After missing Christmas with his children, Hailie, Alaina and Stevie, Eminem checked himself out of the facility, weak and not fully detoxed. He tore the meniscus in his knee after falling asleep on his sofa, requiring surgery; after he returned home, he had a seizure. His drug use \"ramped right back to where it was before\" within a month. Eminem began to attend church meetings to get clean, but after he was asked for autographs he sought help from a rehabilitation counselor. He began an exercise program that emphasized running. Elton John was a mentor during this period, calling Eminem once a week to check on him. Eminem has been sober since April 20, 2008.  Threats In April 2020, Matthew David Hughes, a 26-year-old homeless man, broke into Eminem house in Clinton Township, Macomb County, Michigan, breaking a kitchen window with a brick paver. Eminem woke up with Hughes standing behind him and Hughes said that he was there to kill Eminem. In a plea agreement in 2021, Hughes pleaded guilty to second-degree home invasion in exchange for dismissal of other charges; he was sentenced to probation and time served (524 days in the county jail). In 2019, Hughes had pleaded guilty to breaking into a Rochester Hills home in search of Eminem. On August 30, 2023, it was revealed that the perpetrator of the 2023 Jacksonville shooting Ryan Palmeter targeted Eminem and Machine Gun Kelly as his victims in a racially-motivated attack.  Politics In multiple songs, Eminem has expressed political views that align with the Democratic Party; however, he has refrained from direct endorsements of politicians, focusing more on criticisms instead. The first was \"Mosh\", which was released in 2004, a few weeks before the 2004 United States presidential election, and heavily criticized then-president George W. Bush but did not directly endorse John Kerry either. Eminem would not express political views again until the 2016 United States presidential election when he released \"Campaign Speech\", which criticized presidential candidate Donald Trump. The following year, Eminem criticized Trump in a freestyle titled \"The Storm\". In the freestyle, Eminem expressed support for former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and the U.S. national anthem protests, and expressed his displeasure for any of his fans that support Trump. In his song \"Darkness\", Eminem heavily references the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting, and at the end of the music video expresses his support for gun control. The week before the 2020 United States presidential election, Eminem approved his song \"Lose Yourself\" to be used in a campaign video for Joe Biden. After the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Eminem posted a tweet to his Twitter expressing his displeasure for the decision saying \"As a father it pisses me off that women have fewer rights 2day than just a few days ago… we r fuckin goin bckwards. Here how 2 help in Michigan. [sic]\" and included a link to a pro-choice organization in Michigan. In 2023, he requested that Republican election candidate Vivek Ramaswamy stop rapping his song \"Lose Yourself\" at campaign rallies, sending Ramaswamy a cease and desist letter.  Faith and beliefs Eminem is a Christian, and has rapped about his faith in a few songs, most notably on the remix to \"Use This Gospel\".  Interests Eminem is a fan of the Detroit Lions and Detroit Pistons.  Feuds Eminem has had lyrical feuds during his career with many recording artists, including Christina Aguilera, Machine Gun Kelly, Everlast, Cage, Insane Clown Posse, Will Smith, Miilkbone, Mariah Carey, Nick Cannon, Limp Bizkit, Benzino, Ja Rule, Vanilla Ice, Canibus, Jermaine Dupri, Joe Budden, Lord Jamar, and Charlamagne tha God.  Insane Clown Posse The feud with fellow Detroit hip hop duo Insane Clown Posse began in 1997, when Eminem was throwing a party to promote his debut EP, Slim Shady EP. He gave Joseph Bruce (aka Violent J from Insane Clown Posse) a flyer which stated \"Featuring appearances by Esham, Kid Rock, and ICP (maybe)\". Bruce asked why Eminem was promoting a possible Insane Clown Posse appearance without first contacting the group. Eminem explained, \"It says maybe. Maybe you will be there; I dont know. That why Im asking you right now. You guys comin to my release party, or what?\". Bruce, upset over not being consulted, responded, \"Fuck no, I aint coming to your party. We might have, if you wouldve asked us first, before putting us on the fuckin flyer like this.\" Eminem took Bruce response as a personal offense, subsequently attacking the group in radio interviews. Bruce and Utsler responded with a parody of Eminem \"My Name Is\" entitled \"Slim Anus\" and other tracks including \"Nuttin But a Bitch Thang\" and \"Please Dont Hate Me\". Eminem insulted Insane Clown Posse on various tracks from his album The Marshall Mathers LP (2000), including \"Marshall Mathers\" and \"Ken Kaniff\". In 2002, Eminem briefly dissed them on his single \"Business\" from The Eminem Show. Insane Clown Posse talked about the feud being squashed in an interview with MTV, saying that Proof squashed the conflict in 2005, which was followed by a bowling game between members of D12 and Psychopathic Records. Violent J stated that, \"He contacted us and we had a bowling game—it was really cool. Were something different. They could have skipped over us and said forget them, but they included us and said let squash it.\"  Everlast and Limp Bizkit In the early 2000s, Eminem was notified while on the Anger Management Tour that former House of Pain member Everlast had mocked him on a song. Everlast claimed that while passing by Mathers in a hotel lobby, Mathers gave him a \"weird look\". Everlast verse from the Dilated Peoples all star track \"Ear Drums Pop (Remix)\" contained a thinly veiled reference to Eminem (\"Cock my hammer, spit a comet like Haley/I buck a .380 on ones that act shady\") and went on to warn \"You might catch a beatdown out where I come from\" in his recounting of the incident. Taking offense to this, Eminem and D12 quickly began work on a retaliatory song, \"I Remember\", which ripped Everlast several times in public and with the song. Eminem and his group D12 responded with \"Quitter\", the second half of which is a take off on 2Pac iconic disstrack \"Hit Em Up\" (a diss song aimed at The Notorious B.I.G.). The track ends with the spoken words, \"Fuck him, that it, Im done, I promise, Im done, that it.\" It was reported that long-time friends of Eminem, nu metal group Limp Bizkit, were meant to be featured on the song, but lead singer Fred Durst canceled at the last moment. The record continued to be released without the group, causing the Everlast-Mathers dispute to continue. In a TRL interview, Limp Bizkit member DJ Lethal, made a statement that if Mathers and Everlast were to fight in real life, Everlast would win. This would lead to an insulting track aimed at both Everlast and Limp Bizkit (namely Durst and Lethal) appearing on D12 2001 mainstream debut album, Devil Night, as the track \"Girls\". Recently, things seem to have settled and Eminem has no longer been heard insulting Everlast or Limp Bizkit. It is currently unknown if the dispute is resolved. During Eminem Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction speech in 2022, he credited House of Pain as an influence.  Canibus The animus with rapper Canibus started when Canibus and Haitian musician Wyclef Jean confronted Eminem and asked him if he had ghost-wrote the track \"The Ripper Strikes Back\" by LL Cool J. Eminem denied that he wrote the track. After he was confronted, Eminem said Canibus was \"rude\" to him. Two years later, Canibus went to see Eminem on the Warped Tour and apologized to him for his reactions and asked him if he still wanted the track. Eminem agreed, but when he heard the track \"Phuck U\" from Canibus album 2000 B.C., he thought the track was directed at him and LL Cool J. Shortly afterwards, Eminem released his third album The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and Canibus decided to continue the \"story\" of Eminem single \"Stan\". He titled the track \"U Didnt Care\" and it continued to take shots at Eminem. Eminem decided to take more shots at Canibus on his album The Eminem Show (2002) on tracks such as \"Say What You Say\", \"When The Music Stops\" and \"Square Dance\". Even though Canibus did not immediately respond to the tracks, Eminem continued to take shots at him, including \"My Name\", a track that Eminem was featured on Xzibit album Man vs. Machine (2002). On November 19, 2002, Canibus responded with the track titled \"Dr.\\u200dC PhD\". Over a year later Eminem released the track \"Can-I-Bitch\". He attacked Canibus in a humorous matter. Since then the hostilities have cooled down, but Canibus tried to provoke a reignition of it when he leaked a track titled \"Air Strike (Pop Killer)\", that featured vocal parts of D12, where Canibus takes shots at Eminem and his deceased friend Proof. D12 member Swift responded to the record publicly and had the following to say about DZK (another rapper featured on the track). \"[He] asked us to do a track with him when he already was teamed up with Canibus without us knowing. They dissed Em, took our verses, and added them to the song, so they can bring traffic and make it seem like we were turning on Em [...] as a desperate attempt to be heard after ducking and dodging Em for 7 years. It was a straight hoe move.\"  Michael Jackson The 2004 music video for \"Just Lose It\" generated controversy by parodying pop icon Michael Jackson child molestation trial, plastic surgery and an incident in which Jackson hair caught on fire while filming a Pepsi commercial in 1984. It was banned on the BET channel, after complaints from Benzino and others (but was later reinstated, as critics of the ban argued that Nelly \"Tip Drill\" video could be seen). Both were only seen on BET: Uncut. However, MTV did not drop it, and the video became one of the most requested on the channel. A week after the release of \"Just Lose It\", Jackson called in to the radio show of Steve Harvey to report his displeasure with the video. \"I am very angry at Eminem depiction of me in his video\", Jackson said in the interview. \"I feel that it is outrageous and disrespectful. It is one thing to spoof, but it is another to be demeaning and insensitive.\" The singer continued: \"Ive admired Eminem as an artist, and was shocked by this. The video was inappropriate and disrespectful to me, my children, my family and the community at large.\" Many of Jackson supporters and friends spoke out about the video, including Stevie Wonder, who called the video \"kicking a man while he down\" and \"bullshit\", and Steve Harvey, who declared, \"Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back.\"  Ja Rule Eminem conflict with rapper Ja Rule started after 50 Cent signed to Shady Records and Aftermath. Ja Rule stated that he had a problem with Eminem and Dr. Dre of signing someone he had conflict with. On November 19, Ja Rule and Irv Gotti were special guests on Star and Bucwild morning show on Hot 97 NYC. Gotti claimed to have \"legal documents\" referring to an order of protection 50 Cent \"has on him\". Ja Rule threatened, that if 50 Cent released any diss track, he would take action towards his two producers. However, Dr. Dre was the one who produced 50 Cent track \"Back Down\" in 2003 from the album Get Rich Or Die Tryin, which included lyrics insulting not only Murder Inc., but also Ja Rule family including his then-two-year-old son and seven-year-old daughter Britney Atkins as in the song, 50 Cent raps, \"Your Mami, your Papi, that bitch you chasin your lil dirty ass kids, Ill fuckin erase them.\" Fellow rapper Busta Rhymes decided to join the conflict when he was featured on the track \"Hail Mary 2003\", with Eminem and 50 Cent. The feud intensified when Ja Rule released a diss called \"Loose Change\", in which he took shots at 50 Cent as well as Eminem (calling him \"Feminem\") and Dr. Dre (accuse him of being \"bisexual\" and having a fetish for transvestites – \"bringing transvestites home\"). It includes also the lyrics insulting Eminem family, including his then-seven-year-old daughter Hailie Jade: \"Em you claim your mother a crack head and Kim is a known slut, so what Hailie gonna be when she grows up?\". Eminem, along with D12 and Obie Trice, responded with the track \"Doe Rae Me\" (aka \"Hailie Revenge\"). Since then, the rift has allegedly cooled down.  Benzino and The Source magazine In 2003, rapper and The Source co-owner Benzino released a diss single titled \"Pull Your Skirt Up\" which took aim at Eminem. The track attacked Eminem \"street cred\" and accused him of being a tool of the music industry. Eminem had been discovered by The Source after writer Rigo Morales featured him in the magazine famed monthly \"Unsigned Hype\" column. In the same year, The Source released an article written by Kimberly Osorio, which identified and researched the history of an old demo tape that the magazine discovered where Eminem insulted Black women and used the word \"nigger\". The demo featured a song called \"Foolish Pride\", recorded in the late 1980s when Eminem claimed to have been \"dumped\" by his African-American then-girlfriend. Eminem responded with two tracks titled \"Nail in the Coffin\" and \"The Sauce\". Benzino would later release more tracks. As a result of the conflict, Shady/Aftermath ads were pulled from the magazine. XXL, another hip hop magazine which had featured negative coverage of Shady/Aftermath artists since Eminem mocked them in his song \"Marshall Mathers\" from his 2000 album The Marshall Mathers LP, stepped in to fill the void, accepting Shady/Aftermath ads. In January 2024, Eminem reignited the feud with Benzino on a new diss track called \"Doomsday Pt. 2\".  Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon Eminem has written several songs referring to a relationship with R&B singer Mariah Carey, although she denies that they were ever intimate. Eminem has referenced her on many songs, including \"When the Music Stops\", \"Superman\", \"Jimmy Crack Corn\", \"Bagpipes from Baghdad\" and \"The Warning\". While \"Superman\" was released in 2003, Carey released a song entitled \"Clown\" on her album Charmbracelet, released in 2002, which makes similar references in line with her 2009 hit \"Obsessed\". Eminem \"Bagpipes from Baghdad\" from his album Relapse disparages Carey and rapper/then-husband Nick Cannon relationship. Cannon responded to Eminem by saying his career is based on \"racist bigotry\" and that he would get revenge on Eminem, joking that he may return to rapping. Eminem later stated that the couple misinterpreted the track and it was wishing the two the best. Cannon also stated that there were no hard feelings and that he just had to express his feelings about the song. In 2009, Carey released \"Obsessed\", about an obsessed man who claims to have been in a relationship with her. Cannon claimed that the song was not an insult directed at Eminem. However, Eminem responded in late July 2009 by releasing a track titled \"The Warning\". It contained samples of voice mail recordings which Eminem claimed were left by Carey, when the two were dating. Eminem also hinted that he had other evidence of their relationship in his possession. A little over a year later in September 2010, Cannon responded with the song \"Im a Slick Rick\", making fun of Eminem.  Moby After the release of Eminem 2000 album The Marshall Mathers LP, popular electronic music artist Moby began speaking out against the album lyrics, citing references to misogyny and homophobia as unacceptable. Eminem responded back with insulting Moby in \"Without Me\", the lead single off his next album The Eminem Show. In 2004, Moby praised Eminem for criticizing then-U.S. president George W. Bush in the song \"Mosh\", a track from Encore. The feud has since ended. In 2022, Eminem said that he later regretted attacking Moby.  Machine Gun Kelly Eminem and rapper Machine Gun Kelly have had an ongoing feud for several years, and Kelly released a diss track in response to \"Not Alike\" titled \"Rap Devil\" in September 2018; both songs were produced by Ronny J. Kelly continued the feud at a concert, calling it \"a battle between the past and the fucking future\". The song title refers to Eminem \"Rap God\" and Eminem went into the studio days later to record his own response, as did former D12 associate Bizarre. Eminem responded with \"Killshot\" on September 14 and Bizarre \"Love Tap\" was released on September 20. \"Killshot\" garnered 38.1 million streams on YouTube in its first 24 hours and over 80 million views in its first week, making it the most successful debut for a hip hop song and the third-biggest debut in the platform history. The track also debuted at number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it Eminem 20th top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. Kelly has continued the feud publicly.  From Kamikaze Throughout the 2018 album Kamikaze Eminem lyrics criticize other musicians, primarily mumble rappers, and several have responded publicly. Ja Rule responded on social media, re-igniting a feud the two had 15 years prior. 6ix9ine, Iggy Azalea, Joe Budden, Die Antwoord, Lupe Fiasco, and Lord Jamar have also responded publicly, with 6ix9ine releasing the skit \"Legend\" that raps over Eminem \"Lose Yourself\".  Controversies Legal issues Eminem had his first run-in with the law at age 20, when he was arrested for his involvement in a drive-by shooting with a paintball gun. The case was dismissed when the victim did not appear in court. On June 3, 2000, Eminem was arrested during an altercation with Douglas Dail at a car-audio store in Royal Oak, Michigan, when Eminem pulled out an unloaded gun and pointed it at the ground. The next day, in Warren, Michigan, he was arrested again for assaulting John Guerra in the parking lot of the Hot Rock Café when he saw Guerra kissing Eminem wife. Eminem recreated the Guerra assault in \"The Kiss (Skit)\" on The Eminem Show. He pleaded guilty to possession of a concealed weapon and assault, receiving two years probation; however, Guerra assault charge was dropped as part of the plea agreement. On June 28, 2001, Eminem was sentenced to one year probation and community service and was fined about $2,000 on weapon charges stemming from an argument with an employee of Psychopathic Records. In 1999, Eminem mother sued him for $10 million, claiming he was slandering her on The Slim Shady LP. Litigation concluded in 2001, resulting in an award of $1,600 for her damages. On July 7, 2000, Kim Mathers attempted suicide by slitting her wrists, later suing Eminem for defamation after describing her violent death in \"Kim\". Sanitation worker DeAngelo Bailey sued Eminem for $1 million in 2001, accusing him of invading his privacy by publicizing information placing Bailey in a false light in \"Brain Damage\", a song that portrays him as a violent school bully. Although Bailey admitted picking on Eminem in school, he said he merely \"bumped\" Eminem and gave him a \"little shove\". The lawsuit was dismissed on October 20, 2003; Judge Deborah Servitto, who wrote a portion of her opinion in rap-like rhyming verse, ruled that it was clear to the public that the lyrics were exaggerated. On March 31, 2002, French jazz pianist Jacques Loussier filed a $10 million lawsuit against Eminem and Dr. Dre, claiming that the beat for \"Kill You\" was taken from his instrumental \"Pulsion\". Loussier demanded that sales of The Marshall Mathers LP be halted and any remaining copies destroyed. The case was later settled out of court. In 2006, Eminem was accused of assaulting Miad Jarbou, a resident of Royal Oak, Michigan, in the bathroom of a Detroit strip club, but was never charged. Two years later, Jarbou sued Eminem for more than $25,000 in damages. In 2007, Eminem music-publishing company (Eight Mile Style) and Martin Affiliated sued Apple Inc. and Aftermath Entertainment, claiming that Aftermath was not authorized to negotiate a deal with Apple for digital downloads of 93 Eminem songs on Apple iTunes. The case against Apple was settled shortly after the trial began, in late September 2009. In July 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in F.B.T. Productions, LLC v. Aftermath Records that F.B.T. Productions and Eminem were owed a royalty of 50 percent of Aftermath net revenue from licensing his recordings to companies such as Apple, Sprint Corporation, Nextel Communications, Cingular and T-Mobile. In March 2011, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the case. In October 2013, Eminem sampled Chicago-based rap group Hotstylz 2008 viral hit, \"Lookin Boy\", for his 2013 hit single \"Rap God\". The group claims that Eminem did not receive permission to use the sample, nor did he credit or compensate them. In November 2013, Hotstylz released a diss track towards Eminem titled \"Rap Fraud\", where they sample several of his songs and criticize him for not crediting them. In January 2015, TMZ reported that Hotstylz was suing Eminem and his label, Shady Records, for $8 million, for using the 25-second sample of \"Lookin Boy\" on his song \"Rap God\" without their permission.  United States Secret Service On December 8, 2003, the United States Secret Service reported that it was \"looking into\" allegations that Eminem threatened U.S. president George W. Bush in \"We As Americans\" (an unreleased bootleg at the time), with the lyrics: \"Fuck money, I dont rap for dead presidents. Id rather see the president dead, it never been said but I set precedents.\" The incident was included in the video for \"Mosh\", as a newspaper clipping on a wall with articles about unfortunate incidents in Bush career. \"We As Americans\" eventually appeared on Encore deluxe-edition bonus disc with altered lyrics. The original lyrics can be heard at the end of Immortal Technique \"Bin Laden\". In 2018–2019, the Secret Service interviewed Eminem again regarding threatening lyrics towards president Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka.  Allegations of homophobia Some of Eminem lyrics have been criticized for being homophobic, and an Australian politician attempted to ban him from the country. Eminem denies the charge, saying that when he was growing up words such as \"faggot\" and \"queer\" were used generally in a derogatory manner and not specifically toward homosexuals. During a 2010 60 Minutes interview, journalist Anderson Cooper explored the issue:  In 2013, Eminem was accused of homophobia due to the lyrics of the song \"Rap God\", explaining to Rolling Stone, \"I dont know how to say this without saying it how Ive said it a million times. But that word, those kind of words, when I came up battle-rappin or whatever, I never really equated those words ... (to actually mean homosexual)\". In 2018, Eminem was criticized for using the word \"faggot\" against Tyler, the Creator in the song \"Fall\". Eminem later apologized for using the homophobic slur, saying he went \"too far\". Discussing the issue in a multi-part interview with radio host Sway, Eminem explained that while he meant to stand up for himself, \"I think the word that I called him on that song was one of the things where I felt like, This might be too far.\" He added, \"Because in my quest to hurt him [Tyler], I realize that I was hurting a lot of other people by saying it.\" Eminem is a friend of openly gay singer Elton John, and publicly supports gay rights. When asked in an interview with The New York Times about the subject of same-sex marriage being legalized in his home state of Michigan, Eminem responded, \"I think if two people love each other, then what the hell? I think that everyone should have the chance to be equally miserable, if they want\", explaining that his \"overall look on things is a lot more mature than it used to be\".  Legacy Credited for popularizing hip hop to a Middle American audience, Eminem unprecedented global commercial success and acclaimed works for a white rapper is widely recognized for breaking racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. Rising from rags to riches, Eminem anger-fueled music represented widespread angst and the reality of American underclass. He has been greatly influential for artists of various genres. Stephen Hill, the then vice president of African American-themed television network BET (Black Entertainment Television), said in 2002:Eminem gets a pass in the same vein that back during segregation black folks had to be better than average, had to be the best, to be accepted ... he is better than the best. In his own way, he is the best lyricist, alliterator and enunciator out there in hip-hop music. In terms of rapping about the pain that other disenfranchised people feel, there is no one better at their game than Eminem. In 2002, the BBC said that the perception of Eminem as a \"modern-day William Shakespeare\" was comparable to the reception of American singer Bob Dylan: \"Not since Bob Dylan heyday in the mid-1960s has an artist output been subjected to such intense academic scrutiny as an exercise in contemporary soul-searching. US critics point to [Eminem] vivid portraits of disenfranchised lives—using the stark, direct language of the street—as an accurate reflection of social injustice.\" In addition, the BBC highlighted that, \"Where parents once recoiled in horror [to his music], there now seems a greater willingness to acknowledge a music that is striking such a chord among the American young, angry white underclass.\" Dan Ozzi of Vice highlighted that Eminem during the early 2000s was \"the one artist high school kids seemed to unanimously connect with.... he represented everything high school years are about: blind rage, misguided rebellion, adolescent frustration. He was like a human middle finger. An X-rated Dennis the Menace for a dial-up modem generation.\" Writing for Spin in 2002, rock critic Alan Light compared Eminem to the Beatles John Lennon:  Eminem is even starting to bear a resemblance to one of those rock icons ... Marshall Mathers is becoming something like this generation John Lennon ... Lennon and Eminem were both subjects of pickets and protests; they both wrote songs about troubled relationships with their mothers; they both wrote about their strange public lives with their wives; they both wrote about how much they loved their kids. Lennon, of course, was able to find ways to use his voice to advocate for peace rather than just blasting away at litigious family members and various pop stars, but still, few other pop musicians since Lennon have found a way to render their private psychodramas into compelling art as effectively as Eminem. Regarding his rehearsal with Eminem for the \"Stan\" duet at the 2001 Grammy Awards, English singer Elton John said, \"[When] Eminem made his entrance, I got goose bumps, the likes of which I have not felt since I first saw Jimi Hendrix, Mick Jagger, James Brown and Aretha Franklin. Eminem was that good. I just thought, Fuck, this man is amazing. There are very few performers who can grab you like that the first time—only the greats.\" John further praised Eminem, saying, \"Eminem is a true poet of his time, someone well be talking about for decades to come. He tells stories in such a powerful and distinctive way. As a lyricist, he one of the best ever. Eminem does for his audience what [Bob] Dylan did for his: He writes how he feels. His anger, vulnerability and humor come out.\"Concerning the controversy surrounding Eminem due to his transgressive music, American entertainer Madonna had said, \"I like the fact that Eminem is brash and angry and politically incorrect ... He stirring things up, he provoking a discussion, he making people blood boil. He reflecting what going on in society right now. That is what art is supposed to do.\" American musician Stevie Wonder also said, \"Rap to me is a modern blues—a statement of how and where people are at ... I think art is a reflection of our society, and people dont like to confront the realities in society ... But until we really confront the truth, we are going to have a Tupac or Eminem or Biggie Smalls to remind us about it—and thank God. They force people to look at realities in society.\" The previously mentioned Bob Dylan praised Eminem, along with other artists, in a 2022 interview with the Wall Street Journal. Eminem has been credited with boosting the careers of hip hop proteges such as 50 Cent, Yelawolf, Stat Quo, Royce da 59\", Cashis, Obie Trice, Bobby Creekwater, Boogie and hip hop groups such as D12 and Slaughterhouse. A number of artists have cited Eminem as an influence, including The Weeknd, Usher, Rae Sremmurd, Logic, Joyner Lucas, Lil Wayne, 50 Cent, Kendrick Lamar, Ed Sheeran, J. Cole, Chance the Rapper, Regina Spektor, Lana Del Rey, and Juice WRLD.  Achievements and honors With global sales of over 220 million records, Eminem is one of the best-selling music artists ever. He has had thirteen number-one albums on the Billboard 200: nine solo, two with D12 and one with Bad Meets Evil. He was the bestselling music artist from 2000 to 2009 in the US according to Nielsen SoundScan. He was also the bestselling male music artist in the United States of the 2010s. He has sold 47.4 million albums in the country and 107.5 million singles in the US. The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Curtain Call: The Hits, \"Lose Yourself\", \"Love the Way You Lie\" and \"Not Afraid\" have all been certified Diamond or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Eminem has over ten billion views of his music videos on his YouTube Vevo page, and in 2014 Spotify named him the most-streamed music artist ever. Among Eminem awards is 15 Grammy Awards, eight American Music Awards and 17 Billboard Music Awards, Billboard named him the \"Artist of the Decade (2000–2009)\". In 2013, he received the Global Icon Award at that year MTV Europe Music Awards ceremony. His success in 8 Mile saw him win the 2002 Academy Award for Best Original Song for his song \"Lose Yourself\", co-written with Jeff Bass and Luis Resto, making him the first rapper to receive the award. He also won the MTV Movie & TV Awards for Best Actor in a Movie and Best Breakthrough Performance and the Critics Choice Movie Award for Best Song for \"Lose Yourself\". Eminem has also been included and ranked in several publications lists. Rolling Stone included him in its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time. He was ranked 9th on MTV Greatest MCs of All Time list. He was ranked 13th on MTV 22 Greatest Voices in Music list and 79th on the VH1 100 Greatest Artists of All Time lists. He was ranked 82nd on Rolling Stone \"The Immortals\" list. In 2010, MTV Portugal ranked Eminem the 7th biggest icon in popular music history. In 2012, The Source ranked him 6th on their list of the Top 50 Lyricists of All Time, while About.com ranked him 7th on its list of the 50 Greatest MCs of Our Time (1987–2007). In 2015, Eminem was placed third on \"The 10 Best Rappers of All Time\" list by Billboard. In 2008, Vibe readers named Eminem the Best Rapper Alive. In 2011, Eminem was labeled the \"King of Hip-Hop\" by Rolling Stone based on an analysis of album sales, chart positions, YouTube views, social media following, concert grosses, industry awards and critical ratings of solo rappers who released music from 2009 to the first half of 2011. Eminem was also inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Class of 2022, alongside Duran Duran and Dolly Parton.

              " 'Curtis James Jackson III (born July 6, 1975), known professionally as 50 Cent, is an American rapper, actor, television producer, and businessman. Born in South Jamaica, a neighborhood of Queens, Jackson began pursuing a musical career in 1996. In 1999-2000, he recorded his \"debut\" album Power of the Dollar for Columbia Records; however, he was struck by nine bullets during a shooting in May 2000, causing its release to be cancelled and Jackson to be dropped from the label. His 2002 mixtape, Guess Who Back? was discovered by Detroit rapper Eminem, who signed Jackson to his label Shady Records, an imprint of Dr. Dre Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records that same year. His debut studio album, Get Rich or Die Tryin (2003) was released to critical acclaim and commercial success. Peaking atop the Billboard 200, it spawned the Billboard Hot 100-number one singles \"In da Club\" and \"21 Questions\" (featuring Nate Dogg), and received nonuple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). That same year, he launched the record label G-Unit Records, namesake of a hip hop group he formed two years prior; the label initial signees were its members, fellow East Coast rappers Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo. His second album, The Massacre (2005) was met with similar success and supported by his third number-one single, \"Candy Shop\" (featuring Olivia). He adopted a lighter, further commercially-oriented approach for his third and fourth albums, Curtis (2007) and Before I Self Destruct (2009)—both were met with critical and commercial declines—and aimed for a return to his roots with his fifth album, Animal Ambition (2014). He has since focused on his career in television and media, having executive-produced and starred in the television series Power (2014–2020), as well as its numerous spin-offs under his company G-Unit Films and Television Inc. Jackson has sold over 30 million albums worldwide and won several awards, including a Grammy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, thirteen Billboard Music Awards, six World Music Awards, three American Music Awards and four BET Awards. In his acting career, Jackson first starred in the semi-autobiographical film Get Rich or Die Tryin (2005), which was critically panned. He was also cast in the war film Home of the Brave (2006), and the crime thriller Righteous Kill (2008). Billboard ranked Jackson as 17th on their \"50 Greatest Rappers\" list in 2023, and named him the sixth top artist of the 2000s decade. Rolling Stone ranked Get Rich or Die Tryin and \"In da Club\" in its lists of the \"100 Best Albums of the 2000s\" and \"100 Best Songs of the 2000s\" at numbers 37 and 13, respectively.  Early life Jackson was born in the borough of Queens, New York City, and raised in its South Jamaica neighborhood by his mother Sabrina. Sabrina, a drug dealer, raised Jackson until she died in a fire when Jackson was eight years old. Jackson revealed in an interview that his mother was a lesbian. After his mother death and his father departure, Jackson was raised by his grandparents. He began boxing at about age 11, and when he was 14, a neighbor opened a boxing gym for local youth. \"When I wasnt killing time in school, I was sparring in the gym or selling  crack on the strip,\" Jackson remembered. He sold crack during primary school. \"I was competitive in the ring and hip-hop is competitive too ... I think rappers condition themselves like boxers, so they all kind of feel like theyre the champ.\" At age 12, Jackson began dealing narcotics when his grandparents thought he was in after-school programs, and brought guns and drug money to school. In the tenth grade, he was caught by metal detectors at Andrew Jackson High School: \"I was embarrassed that I got arrested like that ... After I got arrested I stopped hiding it. I was telling my grandmother [openly], I sell drugs.\" On June 29, 1994, Jackson was arrested for selling four vials of cocaine to an undercover police officer. He was arrested again three weeks later, when police searched his home and found heroin, ten ounces of crack cocaine, and a starting pistol. Although Jackson was sentenced to three to nine years in prison, he served six months in a boot camp and earned his GED. He has said that he did not use cocaine himself. Jackson adopted the nickname \"50 Cent\" as a metaphor for change. The name was inspired by Kelvin Martin, a 1980s Brooklyn robber known as \"50 Cent\"; Jackson chose it \"because it says everything I want it to say. Im the same kind of person 50 Cent was. I provide for myself by any means.\"  Career 1996–2002: Rise to fame, shooting, and early mixtapes Jackson began rapping in a friend basement, where he used turntables to record over instrumentals. In 1996, a friend introduced him to Jam Master Jay of Run-DMC, who was establishing Jam Master Jay Records. Jay taught him how to count bars, write choruses, structure songs, and make records. Jackson first appearance was on \"React\" with Onyx, for their 1998 album Shut Em Down. He credited Jam Master Jay for improving his ability to write hooks, and Jay produced Jackson first (unreleased) album. In 1999, after Jackson left Jam Master Jay, the platinum-selling producers Trackmasters signed him to Columbia Records. They sent him to an upstate New York studio, where he produced 36 songs in two weeks; 18 were included on his 2000 album, Power of the Dollar. Jackson founded Hollow Point Entertainment with former G-Unit member Bang Em Smurf. Jackson popularity began to grow after the successful, controversial underground single \"How to Rob\", which he wrote in a half-hour car ride to a studio. The track comically describes how he would rob famous artists. Jackson explained the song rationale: \"There a hundred artists on that label, you gotta separate yourself from that group and make yourself relevant.\" Rappers Jay-Z, Kurupt, Sticky Fingaz, Big Pun, DMX, Wyclef Jean, and the Wu-Tang Clan responded to the track, and Nas invited Jackson to join him on his Nastradamus tour. Although \"How to Rob\" was intended to be released with \"Thug Love\" (with Destiny Child), two days before he was scheduled to film the \"Thug Love\" music video, Jackson was shot and hospitalized. On May 24, 2000, Jackson was attacked by a gunman outside his grandmother former home in South Jamaica. After getting into a friend car, he was asked to return to the house to get some jewelry; his son was in the house, and his grandmother was in the front yard. Jackson returned to the back seat of the car, and another car pulled up nearby; an assailant walked up and fired nine shots at close range with a 9mm handgun. Jackson was shot in the hand, arm, hip, both legs, chest, and left cheek. His facial wound resulted in a swollen tongue, the loss of a wisdom tooth and a slightly slurred voice; his friend was wounded in the hand. They were driven to a hospital, where Jackson spent 13 days. The alleged attacker, Darryl \"Homicide\" Baum, Mike Tyson close friend and bodyguard, was killed three weeks later. Jackson recalled the shooting: \"It happens so fast that you dont even get a chance to shoot back .... I was scared the whole time ... I was looking in the rear-view mirror like, Oh shit, somebody shot me in the face! It burns, burns, burns.\" In his autobiography, From Pieces to Weight: Once upon a Time in Southside Queens, he wrote: \"After I got shot nine times at close range and didnt die, I started to think that I must have a purpose in life ... How much more damage could that shell have done? Give me an inch in this direction or that one, and Im gone.\" Jackson used a walker for six weeks and fully recovered after five months. When he left the hospital, he stayed in the Poconos with his girlfriend and son, and his workout regime helped him develop a muscular physique. In the hospital, Jackson signed a publishing deal with Columbia Records before he was dropped from the label and blacklisted by the recording industry because of his song, \"Ghetto Quran\". Unable to work in a U.S. studio, he went to Canada. With business partner Sha Money XL, Jackson recorded over thirty songs for mixtapes to build a reputation. In a HitQuarters interview, Marc Labelle of Shady Records A&R said that Jackson used the mixtape circuit to his advantage: \"He took all the hottest beats from every artist and flipped them with better hooks. They then got into all the markets on the mixtapes and all the mixtape DJs were messing with them.\" Jackson popularity increased, and in 2002 he released the mixtape Guess Who Back?. He then released 50 Cent Is the Future backed by G-Unit, a mixtape revisiting material by Jay-Z and Raphael Saadiq.  2002–2007: Mainstream breakthrough, Get Rich or Die Tryin, and The Massacre In 2002, Eminem heard Jackson Guess Who Back? album, received from Jackson attorney (who was working with Eminem manager, Paul Rosenberg). Impressed, Eminem invited Jackson to fly to Los Angeles and introduced him to Dr. Dre. After signing a $1 million record deal, Jackson released No Mercy, No Fear. The mixtape featured one new track, \"Wanksta\", which appeared on Eminem 8 Mile soundtrack. Jackson was also signed by Violator Management and Sha Money XL Money Management Group. 50 Cent released his debut album, Get Rich or Die Tryin (described by AllMusic as \"probably the most hyped debut album by a rap artist in about a decade\"), in February 2003. Rolling Stone noted its \"dark synth grooves, buzzy keyboards and a persistently funky bounce\", with Jackson complementing the production in \"an unflappable, laid-back flow\". It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 872,000 copies in its first four days. The lead single, \"In da Club\" (noted by The Source for its \"blaring horns, funky organs, guitar riffs and sparse hand claps\"), set a Billboard record as the most listened-to song in radio history within a week. Interscope began funding and distributing for Jackson label, G-Unit Records, in 2003. He signed Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo and Young Buck as members of G-Unit, and The Game was later signed in a joint venture with Dr. Dre Aftermath Entertainment. G-Unit Records replaced Jackson previous imprint, Rotten Apple Entertainment. 50 Cent executive produced Lloyd Banks June 2004 debut studio album, The Hunger for More, which achieved Platinum status in America. 50 Cent also contributed vocals to Lloyd Banks hit single, \"On Fire\". In March 2005, 50 Cent second commercial album, The Massacre, sold 1.14 million copies in its first four days (the highest in an abbreviated sales cycle) and was number one on the Billboard 200 for six weeks. He was the first solo artist with three singles in the Billboard top five in the same week with \"Candy Shop\", \"Disco Inferno\" and \"How We Do\". According to Rolling Stone, \"50 secret weapon is his singing voice - the deceptively amateur-sounding tenor croon that he deploys on almost every chorus\". 50 Cent video game, 50 Cent: Bulletproof was released in November 2005. 50 Cent portrays himself and provides his likeness and voice in the video game, with the video game also featuring music from his first two studio albums.  After The Game departure Jackson signed Olivia and rap veterans Mobb Deep to G-Unit Records, with Spider Loc, M.O.P., 40 Glocc and Young Hot Rod later joining the label, who all eventually departed the label. Jackson expressed an interest in working with rappers other than G-Unit, such as Lil Scrappy of BME, LL Cool J of Def Jam, Mase of Bad Boy and Freeway of Roc-A-Fella, and recorded with several.  2007–2010: Curtis, sales battle with Kanye West, and Before I Self Destruct In September 2007, 50 Cent released his third album, Curtis, which was inspired by his life before Get Rich or Die Tryin. It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, selling 691,000 copies during its first week. It sold behind Kanye West Graduation, released the same day; the outcome of this highly-publicized sales battle between Jackson and West has been accredited to the commercial decline of the gangsta rap and \"bling era\" style that previously dominated mainstream hip-hop. On the September 10, 2008, episode of Total Request Live, Jackson said his fourth studio album, Before I Self Destruct, would be \"done and released in November\". He released \"Ok, Youre Right\", produced by Dr. Dre for Before I Self Destruct, on May 18, 2009, and was scheduled to appear in a fall 2009 episode of VH1 Behind the Music. On September 3, 2009, Jackson posted a video  for the Soundkillers Phoenix- produced track, \"Flight 187\", introducing his mixtape and book (The 50th Law). The song, with lyrics inspiring speculation about tension between Jackson and Jay-Z, was a bonus track on the iTunes version of Before I Self Destruct. Before I Self Destruct was released on November 9, 2009 and debuted at number 5 on the Billboard 200, giving 50 Cent his fourth consecutive top 5 album in the US.  2010–2015: New musical directions, new business ventures, and Animal Ambition In a Contactmusic.com interview, Jackson said he was working on a Eurodance album, Black Magic, inspired by European nightclubs: \"First they played hip-hop which suddenly changed to uptempo songs, known as Eurodance\". He later said he had changed his next album to The Return of the Heartless Monster after writing different material when he returned home from the Invitation Tour in 2010, shelving Black Magic. On September 3, Jackson supported Eminem on his and Jay-Z The Home & Home Tour, performing \"Crack A Bottle\" with Eminem and Dr. Dre amid rumors of tension between Jackson and Dre. He \"recorded 20 songs to a whole different album concept\" before putting them aside, wanting his new album to have the \"aggression\" of Get Rich or Die Tryin. Jackson tweeted that the album was \"80 percent done\" and fans could expect it in the summer of 2011. It was ultimately delayed a year due to disagreements with Interscope Records, with Jackson saying that he would release it in November 2011 with a different title than Black Magic. Eminem would appear on the album, and Jackson said he was working with new producers such as Boi-1da and Alex da Kid. Cardiak, who produced Lloyd Banks \"Start It Up\", confirmed that he produced a song for the upcoming album.  Jackson released a song, \"Outlaw\", from his fifth album on the Internet on June 16, 2011. The single, produced by Cardiak, was released on iTunes on July 19 (although Jackson tweeted that it was not the album first single). The rapper planned to write a semi-autobiographical young-adult novel about bullying, different from his previous books which focused on his life and the rules of power. According to the book publisher, the first-person novel (about a 13-year-old schoolyard bully \"who finds redemption as he faces what he done\") was scheduled for publication in January 2012. In a series of tweets, Jackson said that the delay of his fifth album was due to disagreements with Interscope Records, later suggesting that it would be released in November 2011 with his headphone line (SMS by 50). He speculated to MTV News about not renewing his five-album contract with Interscope: \"I dont know ... It will all be clear in the negotiations following me turning this actual album in. And, of course, the performance and how they actually treat the work will determine whether you still want to stay in that position or not.\" On June 20, 2011, Jackson announced the release of Before I Self Destruct II after his fifth album. Although he planned to shoot a music video for the fifth album lead single, \"Im On It\", on June 26 the video was never filmed. Jackson told Shade45, \"I did four songs in Detroit with Eminem. I did two with Just Blaze, a Boi-1da joint, and I did something with Alex da Kid. We made two that are definite singles and the other two are the kinds of records that we been making, more aimed at my core audience, more aggressive, more of a different kind of energy to it.\" He released \"Street King Energy Track #7\" in September 2011 to promote Street King, his charity-based energy drink. An announcement that Jackson was shooting a music video for \"Girls Go Wild\", the fifth-album lead single featuring Jeremih, was made on September 28, 2011. Jackson fifth album, Street King Immortal, was initially scheduled for a summer 2012 release and postponed until November 13. Disagreements with Interscope Records about its release and promotion led to its temporary cancellation. Its first promo single, \"New Day\" with Dr. Dre and Alicia Keys, was released on July 27. The song was produced by Dr. Dre, mixed by Eminem and written by 50 Cent, Alicia Keys, Royce da 59\" and Dr. Dre. A solo version by Keys was leaked by her husband, Swizz Beatz. \"My Life\", the album second promo single (with Eminem and Maroon 5 lead singer Adam Levine), was released on November 26, 2012. In January 2014, Jackson said he planned to release Animal Ambition in the first quarter of the year, followed by Street King Immortal. On February 20, he left Shady Records, Aftermath Entertainment, and Interscope, signing with Caroline and Capitol Music Group. According to Jackson, although he owed Interscope another album, he was released from his contract because of his friendship with Eminem and Dr. Dre: \"Im a special case and situation. It also because of the leverage of having the strong relationships with Eminem and Dr. Dre. They dont want me to be uncomfortable. They value our friendship to the point that they would never want [to jeopardize] it over that little bit of money.\" That day, he announced that Animal Ambition would be released on June 3 and released its first track. The song, \"Funeral\", was released with a video on Forbes.com. Produced by Jake One, it is a continuation of \"50 Bars\" from a previous album; two more tracks were scheduled for release on March 18. At South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, Jackson performed \"Hold On\" from the new album. That song and \"Dont Worry Bout It\" were released with accompanying videos on March 18. According to Jackson, prosperity would be a theme of the album: \"This project, I had to search for a concept, a really good concept, in my perspective, and that was prosperity. I outlined all the things that would be a part of prosperity, positive and negative [for Animal Ambition].\" Animal Ambition debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200, giving 50 Cent his fifth consecutive top five album in the country, while also debuting at number one on Billboard Independent Albums chart.  2015–2021: Street King Immortal, bankruptcy, and departure from Interscope On May 14, 2015, Jackson revealed in an interview that the first single from Street King Immortal, would be previewed Memorial Day weekend and would likely be released in June. Jackson released \"Get Low\" on May 20, 2015, as the intended first single from his sixth studio album, Street King Immortal. The song, produced by Remo the Hitmaker, features vocals from fellow American rappers 2 Chainz and T.I., as well as American singer Jeremih. He announced bankruptcy on July 13, 2015. On March 31, 2017, Interscope Records released 50 Cent final album for the label, a greatest hits album titled Best Of. In 2020, Jackson led the executive-producer duties for late rapper Pop Smoke debut album, Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon, having been one of Pop Smoke biggest inspirations. The album was released on July 3, 2020. Jackson curated the album, desiring to finish it after Pop had died. He contacted many of the artists involved, and also features on one of the album tracks, \"The Woo\". The Woo also features vocals from fellow American rapper Roddy Ricch. In 2020, it was reported that Jackson was producing two television series for Starz, an anthology about hip hop and a biographical drama about sports agent Nicole Lynn. In 2021, he became one of the headliners of the music festival Golden Sand in Riviera Maya. In a July 2021 interview with The Independent, 50 Cent confirmed that he had officially decided to shelve his Street King Immortal album after it spent a decade in development hell. He even confirmed that he plans to release a completely new project.  2021–present: Focusing on acting and media production, Super Bowl LVI halftime show performance In May 2021, Curtis Jackson moved to Houston. This was thought to be for lower taxes, no income tax, and for the rapper scene, as well as other ventures such as writing new screenplays. Also, Jackson, Horizon United Group, and Houston Independent School District began a partnership on a project that would help high school students learn the business skills that define successful entrepreneurship. While living in Houston, Curtis Jackson was in the process of writing screenplays for new crime shows. In August 2021, he was confirmed to be starring in the upcoming Expend4bles film. In the fall of 2021, Starz released \"Black Mafia Family,\" a series based on two brothers in Detroit who ran a drug trafficking and money laundering operation from the mid-1980s until 2005. Jackson is the executive producer of the show, which is based on a true story. On February 13, 2022, 50 Cent was a surprise performer in the Super Bowl LVI halftime show, receiving a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Live) in September for the performance.  Artistry Jackson cites Boogie Down Productions, Big Daddy Kane, The Juice Crew, EPMD and KRS-One as his rapping influences, while citing LL Cool J as an inspiration behind his writing of \"21 Questions\". Jackson also states that he drew influences from Nas, Rakim and The Notorious B.I.G. while working on Animal Ambition.  Business ventures Jackson has had a highly successful business career. He is financially invested in a highly diversified variety of industries. Jackson is now involved in artist and talent management, record, television, and film production, footwear, apparel, fragrances, liquor, video games, mobile apps, book publishing, headphones, along with health drinks and dietary supplements. His broad business and investment portfolio contains investments in a variety of sectors including real estate, financial market investments, mining, boxing promotion, vodka, fragrances, consumer electronics and fashion. He established his own record label G-Unit Records in 2003 following his mainstream success. In November 2003, he signed a five-year deal with Reebok to distribute a G-Unit Sneakers line for his G-Unit Clothing Company. In an interview, Jackson said his businesses had a habit of doing well as he saw all of his ventures both past and present as revolving around his alter ego. Jackson has also started a book publishing imprint, G-Unit Books on January 4, 2007, at the Time Warner Building in New York. He has written a number of books including a memoir, From Pieces To Weight in 2005 where it sold 73,000 copies in hardcover and 14,000 copies in paperback; a crime novel and a book with Robert Greene titled The 50th Law, an urban take on The 48 Laws of Power. In November 2011, Jackson released 50 Cent Playground, a young adult fiction novel about a bullied, violent boy and his gay mother. One of Jackson first business ventures was a partnership with Glacéau to create an enhanced water drink called Formula 50. In October 2004, Jackson became a beverage investor when he was given a minority share in the company in exchange for becoming a spokesperson after learning that he was a fan of the beverage. The health conscious Jackson noted that he first learned of the product while at a gym in Los Angeles, and stated that \"they do such a good job making water taste good\". After becoming a minority shareholder and celebrity spokesperson, Jackson worked with the company to create a new grape flavored \"Formula 50\" variant of VitaminWater and mentioned the drinks in various songs and interviews. In 2007, Coca-Cola purchased Glacéau for $4.1 billion and, according to Forbes, Jackson, who was a minority shareholder, earned $100 million from the deal after taxes. Though he no longer has an equity stake in the company, Jackson continues to act as a spokesperson for VitaminWater, supporting the product including singing about it at the BET Awards and expressing his excitement over the company continuing to allow his input on products. He joined Right Guard to introduce a body spray (Pure 50 RGX) and endorsed Magic Stick condoms, planning to donate part of their proceeds to increasing HIV awareness. Jackson signed a multi-year deal with Steiner Sports to sell his memorabilia, and announced plans for a dietary-supplement company in conjunction with his film Spectacular Regret in August 2007.  Jackson has founded two film production companies: G-Unit Films in 2003 and Cheetah Vision in 2008. Cheetah Vision produces low budget action thrillers for foreign film markets across the world. When G-Unit Films folded, he focused on Cheetah Vision and the company obtained $200 million in funding in 2010. In 2010, Jackson revived G-Unit Films, renaming the company to G-Unit Films and Television Inc. The company has joint ventures with Will Packer production company Will Packer Productions and Universal Television. In over 18 months, Jackson has sold projects to six different networks. Among them was Power, a STARZ drama in which he not only co-stars but also serves as co-creator and executive producer. Power debuted in June 2014 and was renewed for a second season after one episode. Jackson serves as a co-star, co-creator and executive television producer of the STARZ network drama where he signed a 2-year contract with representation coming from the Agency for the Performing Arts. Ratings have been a success for Starz. with the second-season premiere being the highest-ever season with 1.43 million people tuning in live. \"Power\" ended in 2020. Jackson is the executive producer of three of its spin-offs, \"PowerBook II: Ghost,\" \"PowerBook III: Raising Kanan,\" and \"Powerbook IV: Force.\" In 2002, Jackson filed an application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office to register the term \"50 Cent\" as a trademark for clothing, sound recordings, and live performances. The application was published in 2003, and registration issued in 2004. He has since filed for additional trademark registrations. In July 2011, Jackson launched a philanthropic initiative to provide food for one billion starving people in Africa by 2016, joining Pure Growth Partners to introduce Street King. A portion of the proceeds from each Street King purchase would be used to provide a daily meal to an underprivileged child. The partnership coincides with Jackson goal to feed a billion people in Africa during the next five years. \"50 Cent and I share a common vision: to address the world problems through smart and sustainable business models,\" said Chris Clarke, founder and CEO of Pure Growth Partners. \"With the rampant starvation in Africa and hunger afflicting children worldwide, we need socially responsible businesses that affect real change now more than ever.\" Jackson said, \"Im inspired by Clarke vision and innovative approaches to tackling serious issues. It our mission with Street King to really change children lives around the world.\" In 2011, he founded SMS Audio, a consumer-electronics company selling Street by 50 headphones, pledging to donate a portion of their sales to charity. In April 2015, SMS announced new co-branding deals with Reebok and Marvel. It added those to existing partnerships with Walt Disney Parks, Lucasfilm Star Wars, and Intel. In 2014, Jackson became a minority shareholder in Effen Vodka, a brand of vodka produced in the Netherlands, when he invested undisclosed amount in the company Sire Spirits LLC. He currently endorses the product via his live concert performances and social media. The rapper was asked to take part in two promotional bottle signings, one in Oak Creek and another in Sun Prairie. Jackson made an appearance at Liquor Warehouse in Syracuse, New York on April 25, 2015, where he reportedly sold 1,400 bottles (277 gallons) of Jackson signature liquor brand. Liquor Warehouse owner George Angeloro reportedly stocked 300 cases (1,800 bottles or 357 gallons) of Effen Vodka, which sells for $30 a bottle, prior to the event. In December 2014, Jackson signed a $78 million deal with FRIGO Revolution Wear, a luxury underwear brand. The joint venture is partnered between Jackson, basketball player Carmelo Anthony, baseball player Derek Jeter and Mathias Ingvarsson, the former president of mattress company Tempur-Pedic. Jackson became the chief fashion designer for the brands single pair of Frigo boxers. In April 2015, Jackson mulled investing in Jamaica, exploring foreign investment opportunities on the island when he met with some local officials and had ongoing discussions on investment opportunities in the Montego Bay resort area.  Investments Over the years, Jackson invested his earnings from music and celebrity endorsements in an array of privately controlled companies, real estate, and stocks and bonds. A portion of his investments lost value during the 2008 recession. In December 2008, he told the Canadian press that he had been affected by the recession, losing several million dollars in the stock market. Unable to sell his Connecticut mansion, Jackson postponed Before I Self-Destruct due to the severity of the economic downturn. His Farmington mansion located on 50 Poplar Hill Drive that he tried to sell for years filed for bankruptcy in Connecticut in 2015 listed an asking price for that property in 2012 at $10 million but was valued at $8.3 million in 2015. He first tried to sell the house in 2007 for $18.5 million, and dropped the price several times in the next five years, when it was on and off the market. In January 2011, Jackson reportedly made $10 million after using Twitter to promote a marketing company which he was part shareholder of. His endorsements company G Unit Brands Inc. revealed through a public SEC filing controls 12.9 per cent of H&H Imports, which is a parent company of TV Goods – the firm responsible for marketing his range of headphones, Sleek by 50 Cent. Jackson bought stock in the company on November 30, 2010, a week after it offered buyers 180 million shares at 17 cents each. Jackson later made a stock recommendation on Twitter, causing its share value to rise from four cents to nearly 50 cents (32p) each, closing on Monday at 39 cents (25p). Jackson was later investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for breaching securities laws following his tweet which may have constituted allegations of Insider trading via his Pump and dump stock investment strategy. In 2013, Jackson became a minority investor in Hang w/, a live video broadcasting mobile app used by dozens of celebrities to broadcast their daily activities and chat with fans. The app was downloaded more than 1 million times since its launch in March 2013 and had more than 1 million users as of February 2015. Other minority celebrity investors include former NFL player Terrell Owens and record producer Timbaland.  Mining and heavy metals In 2008, Jackson visited a platinum, palladium and iridium mine shaft in South Africa, and met with South African billionaire Patrice Motsepe in talks of purchasing an equity stake in the mine. After his meeting with Motsepe, Jackson considered purchasing equity in the mine and launching his own line of 50 Cent branded platinum.  Boxing promotion On July 21, 2012, Jackson became a licensed boxing promoter when he formed his new company, TMT (The Money Team). Licensed to promote in New York, he was in the process of being licensed in Nevada (where most major fights are held in the U.S.). A former amateur boxer, Jackson signed gold medalist and former featherweight champion Yuriorkis Gamboa and middleweight Olympic medalist Andre Dirrell. On July 29, 2012, he and the boxer Floyd Mayweather, Jr., signed IBF featherweight champion Billy Dib. They unveiled plans to challenge the box-office dominance of mixed martial arts and change the landscape of boxing with TMT Promotions. Boxer Zab Judah also expressed interest in making a deal with Jackson. In December 2012, Mayweather and Jackson parted company, with Jackson taking over the promotion company and founding SMS Promotions with Gamboa, Dirrell, Dib, James Kirkland, Luis Olivares and Donte Strayhorn in his stable.  Bankruptcy On July 13, 2015, Jackson filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut with a debt of $32,509,549.91. On July 17, 2015, the Court issued an order allowing a creditor to proceed with the punitive damages phase of a trial against Jackson in a New York state court, in connection with the alleged release of a private video. His assets were listed as between $10 million and $50 million in his bankruptcy petition, though he testified under oath that he is worth $4.4 million. Citing between $10 million and $50 million in debt, and the same amount in assets. Later in the week, Jackson bankruptcy lawyers elucidated the court documents that legal fees and judgments exceeding $20 million over the past year were the primary cause of the filing. His filings listed 32 entities that he has a stake in. The bankruptcy came days after a jury ordered him to pay $5 million to rapper Rick Ross ex-girlfriend Lastonia Leviston for invading her privacy by posting online a sex tape of her and another man. In addition, Jackson lost a dispute over a failed business deal to come to fruition to his Sleek headphones, where Jackson invested more than $2 million. An ex-partner accused Jackson of later stealing the design of the \"Sleek by 50\" headphones, prompting a judge to award the partner more than $17.2 million. His Connecticut bankruptcy filing states that he owns seven cars valued at more than $500,000, including a 2010 Rolls-Royce and a 1966 Chevrolet Coupe. His expenses of $108,000 a month include $5,000 for gardening along with a monthly income of $185,000, mainly from royalties and income from his external businesses and investments. The court filing says he also owes money to his stylist, his barber, and his fitness coach. Other details in the bankruptcy documents included information about two deals that sold the right to collect royalties of on-air play of his music. Half the rights to his portfolio were sold to the British independent music publishing company Kobalt Music Group for $3 million and the other half for another $3 million with the sales of his albums allowing Jackson to own 100 percent of the rights to the master recordings while paying only for distribution. Zeisler & Zeisler, a Bridgeport law firm, represented 50 Cent in the bankruptcy, which later resulted in Jackson filing a $75 million lawsuit against his own lawyers. He stated that his lawyers did a terrible job of representing him, specifically citing the fallout of his failed venture with Sleek Audio headphones and accused Garvey Schubert Barer, a Wall Street law firm, of failing to \"employ the requisite knowledge and skill necessary to confront the circumstances of the case\".  Corporate positions G-Unity Foundation Inc. – Founder SMS Audio – CEO, founder SK Energy – Founder SMS Promotions – CEO, founder Sire Spirits – Owner Effen Vodka – Former minority shareholder  Personal life 50 Cent has said his life philosophy, following his shooting, is \"When your time comes, you go. I think that comes from God.\" Despite having numerous songs that reference drug and alcohol usage and his ownership of Branson Cognac, Jackson remains teetotal, citing a bad experience with alcohol as his main reason. Forbes noted Jackson wealth in 2007, ranking him second behind Jay-Z in the rap industry. He lived in a Farmington, Connecticut, mansion formerly owned by ex-boxer Mike Tyson. Jackson listed the mansion for sale in 2007 at $18.5 million to move closer to his son (who lived on Long Island at the time). In 2019, the mansion was sold for $2.9 million, with $1 million being donated to tax-deducted charities. The mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut, declared October 12, 2007 \"50 Cent Curtis Jackson Day\", honoring the rapper with a proclamation and a key to the city. One of Jackson New York homes, purchased in January 2007 for $2.4 million and the center of a lawsuit between Jackson and Shaniqua Tompkins, caught fire on May 31, 2008, while he was filming in Louisiana. In December 2008, he told the Canadian press that he had lost several million dollars in the stock market and, unable to sell his Connecticut mansion, had postponed Before I Self-Destruct because of the economic downturn. Jackson won a lawsuit in November 2009 against Taco Bell over the fast-food chain use of his name without permission.  Family and relationships On October 13, 1996, Jackson girlfriend, Shaniqua Tompkins, gave birth to son Marquise. Tompkins later sued Jackson for $50 million in 2009, saying he promised to take care of her for life. The suit, with 15 causes of action, was dismissed by a judge who called it \"an unfortunate tale of a love relationship gone sour\". The two have bickered for years, and have even taken their feud to social media many times. Marquise birth changed Jackson outlook on life: \"When my son came into my life, my priorities changed, because I wanted to have the relationship with him that I didnt have with my father.\" He credited his son for inspiring his career and being the \"motivation to go in a different direction\". Despite this, the two have endured a fractured relationship that began when Jackson and Tompkins separated in 2008. Their feud has been taken to social media numerous times, including in 2020 when Jackson disclosed that he \"used to\" love his son. Jackson has a tattoo \"Marquise\" with an axe on his right biceps (\"The axe is cause Im a warrior. I dont want him to be one, though\"), and has \"50\", \"Southside\" and \"Cold World\" on his back: \"Im a product of that environment. It on my back, though, so it all behind me\". In 2003, Jackson briefly dated actress Vivica A. Fox. He broke up with her only eight months later on the radio. Jackson dated model Daphne Joy and had his second son, Sire Jackson, with her, on September 1, 2012. At the age of two years, Sire modeled for Kidz Safe, a headphone brand for kids, earning $700,000 through his contract.  Political views In 2005, Jackson supported President George W. Bush after rapper Kanye West criticized Bush for a slow response to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. If his felony convictions did not prevent him from voting, he said that he would have voted for the president. Jackson later said that Bush \"has less compassion than the average human. By all means, I dont aspire to be like George Bush.\" In September 2007, he told Time that although he would not endorse a candidate in 2008, he \"liked Hillary [Clinton]\". Six months later, the rapper told MTV News that he had switched his support to Barack Obama after hearing him speak, but had lost interest in politics. Asked his opinion of President Obama May 9, 2012, endorsement of gay marriage, Jackson said, \"Im for it ... Ive encouraged same-sex activities. Ive engaged in fetish areas a couple times.\" He had been criticized for anti-gay comments in the past. Jackson endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He rejected an offer of $500,000 from the Trump campaign to make an appearance on the candidate behalf. However, he endorsed Donald Trump in 2020, due to his dislike of Joe Biden tax plans. A week later, he retracted his endorsement, saying on Twitter \"Fuck Donald Trump, I never liked him\", and endorsed Biden.  Legal issues On June 29, 1994, Jackson was arrested for selling four vials of cocaine to an undercover police officer. He was arrested again three weeks later, when police searched his home and found heroin, ten ounces of crack cocaine and a starter pistol. Although Jackson was sentenced to three to nine years in prison, he served six months in a boot camp (where he earned his high-school equivalency diploma). According to him, he did not use cocaine. Jackson and four members of his entourage were arrested shortly before 2 a.m. on December 31, 2002, when police found a .25-caliber handgun and a .45-caliber pistol in a parked car (which they searched due to its tinted windows) outside a Manhattan nightclub. The rapper was charged with two counts of criminal possession of a weapon. Jackson was sentenced to two years probation on July 22, 2005, for a May 2004 incident, when he was charged with three counts of assault and battery after jumping into an audience when he was hit by a water bottle.  Lawsuits Use of image Jackson filed a lawsuit against an advertising company, Traffix of Pearl River, New York, on July 21, 2007, for using his image in a promotion he said threatened his safety. He was alerted by a staff member to an Internet advertisement on a Myspace page. According to court documents, the advertisement had a cartoon image of the rapper with \"Shoot the rapper and you will win $5000 or five ring tones guaranteed\". Although the ad did not use his name, the image allegedly resembled him and suggested that he endorsed the product. The lawsuit, calling the ad a \"vile, tasteless and despicable\" use of Jackson image which \"quite literally call[ed] for violence against him\", sought unspecified punitive damages and a permanent injunction against the use of his image without permission.  Use of name In 2008, Jackson sued Taco Bell over an ad campaign in which it invited him to change his name for one day from 50 Cent to 79 Cent, 89 Cent, or 99 Cent, in line with pricing for some of its items, and they would donate $10,000 to the charity of his choice. The case was settled out of court.  Janitor incident While walking through Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in May 2016, Jackson harassed and insulted a janitor at the airport, accusing him of being under the influence. The janitor was a hearing-impaired, autistic teenager named Andrew Farrell. The parents of the janitor had seen the viral video as disrespect and wanted to sue Jackson for his action against their child. The lawsuit was originally over one million dollars, but the parents settled for a $100,000 donation to Autism Speaks and his apology.  Bamba sample In 2016, a judge declared that Brandon Parrott gave Dr. Dre and 50 Cent the rights to \"Bamba\" for the song \"P.I.M.P.\"  Other civil and criminal matters One of his New York homes, purchased for $2.4 million in January 2007 and the center of a lawsuit between Jackson and Shaniqua Tompkins, caught fire on May 30, 2008, while he was filming in Louisiana. On August 5, 2013, Jackson pleaded not guilty to one count of domestic violence and four counts of vandalism in a Los Angeles County court. If convicted of all charges, he faced up to five years in prison and a $46,000 fine. Model-actress Daphne Joy accused Jackson of kicking her and ransacking her bedroom during an argument at her condominium in the Toluca Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles on June 23. He allegedly caused $7,100 in property damage, leaving the scene before police arrived. Judge Ann Nevins has ordered Jackson back to court because of Instagram messages he made over several months. She said Jackson was not fully clear about his funds and indicated posts of the rapper showing stacks of his money. In March 2016, Jackson claimed that he would no longer use Instagram, electing instead to have his profile page operated by someone else. In 2020, Jackson was a subject of controversy for his involvement in a viral video of him giving money to a Burger King restaurant in New York City on behalf of a local scammer who was later arrested and charged for Bitcoin scamming and for assaulting and kidnapping his victims on April 24, 2021.  Feuds Ja Rule Before he signed with Interscope Records, Jackson engaged in a public dispute with rapper Ja Rule and his label, Murder Inc. Records, saying that a friend robbed jewelry from Ja Rule and the latter accused him of orchestrating the robbery. Ja Rule said that the conflict stemmed from a Queens video shoot, when Jackson did not like seeing him \"getting so much love\" from the neighborhood. At The Hit Factory in New York in March 2000, Jackson had an altercation with Murder Inc. associates and received three stitches for a stab wound. Rapper Black Child claimed responsibility for the stabbing, saying that he acted in self-defense when he thought someone reached for a gun. An affidavit by an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agent suggested ties between Murder Inc. and Kenneth \"Supreme\" McGriff, a New York drug lord suspected of involvement in the murder of Jam Master Jay and Jackson shooting. An excerpt read:  The investigation has uncovered a conspiracy involving McGriff and others to murder a rap artist who has released songs containing lyrics regarding McGriff criminal activities. The rap artist was shot in 2000, survived and thereafter refused to cooperate with law enforcement regarding the shooting. Messages transmitted over the Murder Inc. pager indicate that McGriff is involved in an ongoing plot to kill this rap artist, and that he communicates with Murder Inc. employees concerning the target. The end of the Jackson-Ja Rule feud was confirmed in May 2011. According to Ja Rule, \"Im cool. We aint beefing no more. Well never collaborate. That just what it is. You dont have to be at war with somebody, but it also kind of like U.S. and another country that they may not get along with. We dont gotta go to war, but were not friends either. But we can coincide inside of a world. He doing him, and he not thinking about me, and Im doing me and Im not thinking about him.\" On August 7, 2015, the feud between the two rappers later reignited when Ja Rule gave a feedback to a social follower via Twitter over a similar feud between Meek Mill and Drake. Enraged, Jackson later responded with photos and comments via Instagram, only siding with Drake. The feud resurfaced three years later on January 19, 2018, when Ja Rule took to Twitter, calling out 50 Cent on social media.  Jay-Z and Beyoncé In 1999, with the release of the single \"How to Rob\", 50 Cent attacked his rap peers, including Jay-Z, who responded to the provocation with the single \"It Hot (Some Like It Hot)\" in which he raps \"Go against Jigga yo ass is dense/Im about a dollar – what the f*ck is 50 Cents?\". In a 2009 interview with Rolling Stone, 50 Cent accused Jay-Z and his record company Roc-A-Fella Records of being unfair to Beanie Sigel because \"[Jay-Z] didnt have their interests in mind, he was just doing what he had to do for himself.\" The rapper also stated that \"I dont know him personally, [...] I tried to collaborate with him on the Freeway project ... What I did was Freeway went out and found his publishing deal, and we started the album. [...] when it came time to put the record out, he didnt want to shoot his video. He has a god complex.\" 50 Cent also accused Jay-Z of changing in attitude and image since marrying Beyoncé. In 2017, 50 Cent described Jay-Z thirteenth studio album 4:44 as \"golf course music\" in a Instagram post, elaborating: \"I listened to Jay sh*t, that 4:44. [...] [It] was too smart. I felt like I was supposed to be wearing like glasses and shit and like a tie, a fucking sweater around my waist. It was like Ivy League. They dont wanna hear that shit. [...] They just wanna have a good time. You know what Im saying? You cant be the best rapper at 47 because the new n****s is here. They coming with new [music] going on.\" In an interview on the Conan Show, 50 Cent spoke about the album, saying: \"Hip-hop culture connected to youth culture. The kids gonna bring new innovative stuff. He just had the maturity bleed off into the material. [...] But the kids, I dont see them actually listening to it\". In an interview in 2022, 50 Cent reported that in a meeting between him and the couple in Los Angeles, the two rappers were having a heated argument. Beyoncé, seeing them, jumped from a ledge to come to her husband defense. 50 Cent compared the singer to her sister Solange when she hit Jay-Z in the elevator, describing them as \"two gangstas\". In an interview for XXL Mag in 2023, 50 Cent claimed that Jay-Z Grammy wins were due to his marriage to Beyoncé: \"Even Jay-Z career, you can look at that and say the association to Beyoncé is when he started to receive the 16, 17 Grammys, since he been with Beyoncé. And you go, prior to that [he had] one. That came with the association.\" 50 Cent also pointed out that the couple eldest child Blue Ivy Carter won a Grammy even though she does not sing or rap, accusing award ceremonies of giving accolades to the couple just to ensure their attendance during the show. The rapper also reported that his non-win at the Grammys was due to his music being \"a little bit abrasive to conservatives; [...] It didnt matter to me in that time period. Dont give me the trophy. They didnt give me Best New Artist and I sold 13 million records\", while the Carter-Knowles family is more politically agreeable to the music industry.  Fat Joe In connection to his feud with Ja Rule, 50 Cent also took aim at fellow New York rapper Fat Joe, a high profile collaborator of Ja Rule. The feud took aim at Fat Joe following his 2002 track What Luv? featuring Ja Rule and Ashanti. Fat Joe had also continued his collaboration with Murder Inc. on his 2004 track \"New York\" featuring Jadakiss, prompting a diss track aimed at Fat Joe from 50 Cent on his 2005 album The Massacre entitled Piggy Bank. Fat Joe later responded with the track \"My Fofo\" on his album All or Nothing released later that same year. Tensions boiled over during the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards when Fat Joe presented the award for best Hip Hop Video, in which he told the audience \"I feel so safe tonight with all this police protection courtesy of G-Unit\". 50 Cent later retaliated with a profanity-laden diatribe following his performance of the song So Seductive with fellow G-Unit artist Tony Yayo, exclaiming \"Fat Joe a pussy man! [...] Pussy Boy, Nigga What?!\". The feud later affected Fat Joe financially as he sought to secure a $20 million contract endorsing Air Jordan sneakers in early 2005, Michael Jordan himself later cancelled the contract following the VMA incident as he was in fear of conflict with 50 Cent or any other affiliates. Following this; little action was taken on either side as the feud seemed to calm down by 2011. Murder Inc. executive Irv Gotti later expressed anger at Fat Joe following his proposal to quell their longstanding feud with G-Unit in 2010. In 2012; 50 Cent approached Fat Joe in talks of ending the feud following the two agreeing to perform at a memorial ceremony for then recently-deceased music executive Chris Lighty. Despite the prior history between the two, 50 Cent and Fat Joe became close friends and business associates shortly thereafter despite Fat Joe lengthy connections with Ja Rule.  The Game Although Jackson was close to The Game before the latter released his debut album, The Documentary, they grew apart. After The Documentary release, Jackson felt that The Game was disloyal for saying that he did not want to participate in G-Unit feuds with other rappers (such as Nas, Jadakiss and Fat Joe) and his desire to work with artists with which G-Unit was feuding. He said that he wrote six songs for the album and did not receive proper credit, which The Game denied.  Jackson later dismissed The Game from G-Unit on Hot 97. After the announcement, The Game (a guest earlier in the evening) tried to enter the building with his entourage. After they were denied entry, one of his associates was shot in the leg in a confrontation with a group of men leaving the building. When the situation escalated, the rappers held a joint press conference announcing their reconciliation, and fans were uncertain if the rappers had staged a publicity stunt to boost sales of their recently released albums. After the situation cooled, G-Unit criticized The Game street credibility and announced that they would not appear on his albums. During a Summer Jam performance The Game announced a boycott of G-Unit, which he called \"G-Unot\". After the Summer Jam performance The Game recorded \"300 Bars and Runnin\", an extended \"diss\" of G-Unit and Roc-A-Fella Records, for the mixtape You Know What It Is Vol. 3. Jackson responded with his \"Piggy Bank\" music video, with The Game as Mr. Potato Head and parodies of other rivals. They have continued attacking each other, with The Game releasing two more mixtapes: Ghost Unit and a mixtape-DVD, Stop Snitchin, Stop Lyin. Jackson superimposed The Game head on the body of a male stripper for the cover of the Hate It or Love It (G-Unit Radio Part 21) mixtape in response to The Game pictures of G-Unit dressed as the Village People. The Game, under contract to Aftermath Entertainment, signed with Geffen Records to terminate his contractual obligations with G-Unit (although it is claimed that Jackson pressured Dr. Dre to fire him). G-Unit member Spider Loc has insulted The Game in songs, and the latter released \"240 Bars (Spider Joke)\" and \"100 Bars (The Funeral)\" attacking G-Unit and Loc. Jackson response was \"Not Rich, Still Lyin\", mocking The Game. Lloyd Banks replied to the Game on a Rap City freestyle-booth segment, followed by a Game \"diss\" song (\"SoundScan\") ridiculing the 13-position drop of Banks album Rotten Apple on the Billboard 200 chart and its disappointing second-week sales. Banks replied on his mixtape Mo Money In The Bank Pt. 5: Gang Green Season Continues with \"Showtime (The Game Over)\", said that Jackson wrote half of The Documentary and ridiculed The Game suicidal thoughts. In October 2006, The Game made a peace overture (which was not immediately answered) to Jackson, but two days later he said on Power 106 that the peace offer was valid for only one day. In several songs on Doctor Advocate, he implied that the feud was over. He said in July 2009 that the feud had ended with help from Michael Jackson and Diddy, and apologized for his actions. According to Tony Yayo, neither Jackson nor G-Unit accepted his apology and The Game has resumed his calls for a \"G-Unot\" boycott at concerts. Jackson released \"So Disrespectful\" on Before I Self Destruct, targeting Jay-Z, The Game and Young Buck. The Game responded with \"Shake\", poking fun at the music video for Jackson \"Candy Shop\". On January 2, 2015, The Game claimed that he and 50 were \"sworn enemies\", promising never to reconcile with him anymore, but on August 1, 2016, they ended their twelve-year feud when the two were in the Ace of Diamonds strip club and The Game said \"I love 50, man. What happened, that shit was 12 years ago.\" In January 2022, the feud reiterated after 50 critiqued Game Drink Champs interview with N.O.R.E., where he claimed that 50 former competitor Kanye West did \"more for me in two weeks than [Dr.] Dre did for me throughout my entire career\". The Game responded, commenting that he enclosed the entirety of G-Unit as a group and clothing brand \"in a casket\", also expressing his likeliness in the Power television trilogy, but warning 50 to \"leave [the past] alone or else... Im outside #Numinati\". Then, two months later, in March, 50 Cent published a video via Instagram of Game being shunned by former Interscope Records CEO Jimmy Iovine at a basketball game, poking fun of it while also commenting \"50 wrote ya hits\". The Game once again flamed 50 after the claims were brought back up and also bragged to \"get [50] girlfriend out of my DM\". This was believed to have been a consequential result of Game claiming on Drink Champs to be \"the best and a better rapper\" than Eminem, with whom 50 still remains close friends. Additionally, Game manager, Wack 100, has subliminally called out or questioned 50 Cent credibility, over the rapper surprise appearance at the Super Bowl LVI halftime show and ghostwriting allegations.  Camron Jackson issues with former The Diplomats member Camron began in 2007, when they had a live argument on The Angie Martinez Show on Hot 97 radio. Jackson commented that he felt that the music division of Koch Entertainment (known today as MNRK Music Group) was a \"graveyard\", meaning major record labels would not work with their artists. Camron then ridiculed the record sales of G-Unit members Lloyd Banks and Mobb Deep by pointing out that Dipset member Jim Jones outsold both of their albums despite not being signed to a major label, and also went on to clarify that his group, The Diplomats, had a distribution deal from several labels. Both rappers released diss songs with videos on YouTube. Jackson released \"Funeral Music\", and suggested in the song that Camron is no longer able to lead The Diplomats and that Jim Jones should take his place. Camron responded with \"Curtis\" and \"Curtis Pt. II\", in which he makes fun of not only Jackson first name, but also his appearance, calling him \"a gorilla, with rabbit teeth\". Jackson responded by releasing \"Hold On\" with Young Buck. Since 2009, the feud slowly died down, and they eventually reconciled in 2016.  Rick Ross Although Rick Ross began a feud with Jackson over an alleged incident at the 2008 BET Hip Hop Awards, Jackson told news sources he did not remember seeing Ross there. Later that month Ross \"Mafia Music\" was leaked on the Internet, with lyrics apparently disparaging Jackson. Several days later, Jackson released \"Officer Ricky (Go Head, Try Me)\" in response to \"Mafia Music\". The following day, Ross appeared on Shade 45 (Eminem Sirius channel) and told Jackson to come up with something better in 24 hours. Before leaving for Venezuela, Jackson uploaded a video (\"Warning Shot\") and the first of a series of \"Officer Ricky\" cartoons. In early February he uploaded a YouTube video in which he interviewed \"Tia\", the mother of one of Ross children; according to her, Ross is in reality a correctional officer. On February 5, 2009, The Game phoned Seattle radio station KUBE. Asked about the dispute between Jackson and Ross, he sided with Jackson and offered to mediate: \"Rick Ross, holla at your boy, man\" and \"50 eating you, boy.\" On his album Deeper Than Rap, Ross refers to Jackson in \"In Cold Blood\" and Jackson mock funeral is part of the song video. When the song was released, Ross said that he ended Jackson career. \"Rick Ross is Albert From CB4. You ever seen the movie? He Albert,\" Jackson replied in an interview. \"It never gets worse than this. You get a guy that was a correctional officer come out and base his entire career on writing material from a drug dealer perspective such as \"Freeway\" Ricky Ross.\" Their feud rekindled at the 2012 BET Hip Hop Awards, where Jackson and G-Unit members Kidd Kidd, Mike Knox, Tony Yayo were seen on video attacking Gunplay (a member of Ross Maybach Music Group). Gunplay Maybach Music diamond necklace was stolen during the brawl, and several days later Jackson appeared at a Washington, D.C. bowling alley wearing Gunplay chain. On January 30, 2013, Jackson tweeted that Ross attempted drive-by shooting on his birthday three days earlier was \"staged\".

              " 'Andre Romell  Young (born February 18, 1965), known professionally as Dr. Dre, is an American record producer, rapper, record executive, and actor. He is the founder and CEO of Aftermath Entertainment and Beats Electronics, and co-founded and was the president of Death Row Records. Dre began his career as a member of the World Class Wreckin Cru in 1984, and later found fame with the gangsta rap group N.W.A. The group popularized explicit lyrics in hip hop to detail the violence of street life. During the early 1990s, Dre was credited as a key figure in the crafting and popularization of West Coast G-funk, a subgenre of hip hop characterized by a synthesizer foundation and slow, heavy production. Released as Death Row first major project, Dr. Dre solo debut studio album, The Chronic (1992) made him one of the best-selling American music artists of 1993. It earned him a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance with the single \"Let Me Ride\", as well as several accolades for the single \"Nuthin but a G Thang\" (featuring Snoop Dogg). That year, he produced Death Row labelmate Snoop Doggy Dogg debut album Doggystyle, and mentored producers such as his stepbrother Warren G (leading to the multi-platinum debut Regulate... G Funk Era in 1994) and Snoop Dogg cousin Daz Dillinger (leading to the double-platinum debut Dogg Food by Tha Dogg Pound in 1995), as he would mentor other producers including Mel-Man and Scott Storch. In 1996, Dre left Death Row Records to establish his own label, Aftermath Entertainment; his compilation album, Dr. Dre Presents: The Aftermath (1996) and second studio album, 2001 (1999) followed thereafter. During the 2000s, Dr. Dre shifted focus onto production for other artists, occasionally contributing vocals. He signed Eminem in 1998 and 50 Cent in 2002, while extensively contributing to releases by both artists. Aftermath has since signed other artists including the Game, Kendrick Lamar, Anderson .Paak, Silk Sonic, Busta Rhymes, Eve, and Rakim, among others. He has won seven Grammy Awards, including Producer of the Year, Non-Classical. Rolling Stone ranked him number 56 on the list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Outside of music, Dre has acted in films such as Set It Off, The Wash, and Training Day. Accusations of Dr. Dre violence against women have been widely publicized. Following his assault of television host Dee Barnes, he was fined US$2,500, given two years probation, and ordered to perform 240 hours of community service, part of which he fulfilled by making an anti-violence public service announcement. A civil suit was settled out of court. In 2015, Michelle, the mother of one of his children, accused him of domestic violence during their time together as a couple. The abusive relationship is portrayed in her 2016 biopic Surviving Compton: Dre, Suge & Michelle. Lisa Johnson, the mother of three of Dre children, stated that he beat her many times, including while she was pregnant. She was granted a restraining order against him. Former labelmate Tairrie B claimed that Dre assaulted her at a party in 1990, in response to her track \"Ruthless Bitch\". Two weeks following the release of his third album, Compton in August 2015, he issued an apology to the women \"Ive hurt\".  Early life Andre Romell Young was born in Compton, California, on February 18, 1965, the son of Theodore and Verna Young. His middle name is derived from the Romells, his father amateur R&B group. His parents married in 1964, separated in 1968, and divorced in 1972. His mother later remarried to Curtis Crayon and had three children: sons Jerome and Tyree (both deceased) and daughter Shameka. In 1976, Dre began attending Vanguard Junior High School in Compton, but due to gang violence, he transferred to the safer suburban Roosevelt Junior High School. The family moved often and lived in apartments and houses in Compton, Carson, Long Beach, and the Watts and South Central neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Dre has said that he was mostly raised by his grandmother in the New Wilmington Arms housing project in Compton. His mother later married Warren Griffin, which added three step-sisters and one step-brother to the family; the latter would eventually begin rapping under the name Warren G. Dre is also the cousin of producer Sir Jinx. Dre attended Centennial High School in Compton during his freshman year in 1979, but transferred to Fremont High School in South Central Los Angeles due to poor grades. He attempted to enroll in an apprenticeship program at Northrop Aviation Company, but was ineligible due to poor grades. Thereafter, he focused on his social life and entertainment for the remainder of his high school years. Dre frequent absences from school jeopardized his position as a diver on his school swim team. After high school, he attended Chester Adult School in Compton following his mother demands for him to get a job or continue his education. After brief attendance at a radio broadcasting school, he relocated to the residence of his father and residence of his grandparents before returning to his mother house.  Musical career 1985–1986: World Class Wreckin Cru Inspired by the Grandmaster Flash song \"The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel\", Dr. Dre often attended a club called Eve After Dark to watch many DJs and rappers performing live. He subsequently became a DJ in the club, initially under the name \"Dr. J\", based on the nickname of Julius Erving, his favorite basketball player. At the club, he met aspiring rapper Antoine Carraby, later to become member DJ Yella of N.W.A. Soon afterwards he adopted the moniker Dr. Dre, a mix of previous alias Dr. J and his first name, referring to himself as the \"Master of Mixology\". Eve After Dark had a back room with a small four-track studio where Dre and Yella recorded several demos. In their first recording session, they recorded a song entitled \"Surgery\". Dr. Dre earliest recordings were released in 1994 on a compilation titled Concrete Roots. Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the compiled music, released \"several years before Dre developed a distinctive style\", as \"surprisingly generic and unengaging\" and \"for dedicated fans only\". Dre later joined the musical group World Class Wreckin Cru, which released its debut album under the Kru-Cut label in 1985. The group would become stars of the electro-hop scene that dominated early-mid 1980s West Coast hip hop. \"Surgery\", which was officially released after being recorded prior to the group official formation, would prominently feature Dr. Dre on the turntable. The record would become the group first hit, selling 50,000 copies within the Compton area. Dr. Dre and DJ Yella also performed mixes for local radio station KDAY, boosting ratings for its afternoon rush-hour show The Traffic Jam.  1986–1991: N.W.A and Ruthless Records In 1986, Dr. Dre met rapper OShea Jackson—known as Ice Cube—who collaborated with him to record songs for Ruthless Records, a hip hop record label run by local rapper Eazy-E. N.W.A and fellow West Coast rapper Ice-T are widely credited as seminal artists of the gangsta rap genre, a profanity-heavy subgenre of hip hop, replete with gritty depictions of urban crime and gang lifestyle. Not feeling constricted to racially charged political issues pioneered by rap artists such as Public Enemy or Boogie Down Productions, N.W.A favored themes and uncompromising lyrics, offering stark descriptions of violent, inner-city streets. Propelled by the hit \"Fuck tha Police\", the group first full album Straight Outta Compton became a major success, despite an almost complete absence of radio airplay or major concert tours. The Federal Bureau of Investigation sent Ruthless Records a warning letter in response to the song content. After Ice Cube left N.W.A in 1989 over financial disputes, Dr. Dre produced and performed for much of the group second album Efil4zaggin. He also produced tracks for a number of other acts on Ruthless Records, including Eazy-E 1988 solo debut Eazy-Duz-It, Above the Law 1990 debut Livin Like Hustlers, Michelle 1989 self-titled debut, the D.O.C. 1989 debut No One Can Do It Better, J.J. Fad 1988 debut Supersonic and funk rock musician Jimmy Z 1991 album Muzical Madness.  1991–1996: The Chronic and Death Row Records After a dispute with Eazy-E, Dre left the group at the peak of its popularity in 1991 under the advice of friend, and N.W.A lyricist, the D.O.C. and his bodyguard at the time, Suge Knight. Knight, a notorious strongman and intimidator, was able to have Eazy-E release Young from his contract and, using Dr. Dre as his flagship artist, founded Death Row Records. In 1992, Young released his first single, the title track to the film Deep Cover, a collaboration with rapper Snoop Dogg, whom he met through Warren G. Dr. Dre debut solo album was The Chronic, released under Death Row Records with Suge Knight as executive producer. Young ushered in a new style of rap, both in terms of musical style and lyrical content, including introducing a number of artists to the industry including Snoop Dogg, Kurupt, Daz Dillinger, RBX, the Lady of Rage, Nate Dogg and Jewell.  On the strength of singles such as \"Nuthin but a G Thang\", \"Let Me Ride\", and \"Fuck wit Dre Day (and Everybody Celebratin)\" (known as \"Dre Day\" for radio and television play), all of which featured Snoop Dogg as guest vocalist, The Chronic became a cultural phenomenon, its G-funk sound dominating much of hip hop music for the early 1990s. In 1993, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album triple platinum, and Dr. Dre also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance for his performance on \"Let Me Ride\". For that year, Billboard magazine also ranked Dr. Dre as the eighth-best-selling musical artist, The Chronic as the sixth-best-selling album, and \"Nuthin but a G Thang\" as the 11th-best-selling single.  Besides working on his own material, Dr. Dre produced Snoop Dogg debut album Doggystyle, which became the first debut album for an artist to enter the Billboard 200 album charts at number one. In 1994 Dr. Dre produced some songs on the soundtracks to the films Above the Rim and Murder Was the Case. He collaborated with fellow N.W.A member Ice Cube for the song \"Natural Born Killaz\" in 1995. For the film Friday, Dre recorded \"Keep Their Heads Ringin\", which reached number ten on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 1 on the Hot Rap Singles (now Hot Rap Tracks) charts. In 1995, Death Row Records signed rapper 2Pac, and began to position him as their major star: he collaborated with Dr. Dre on the commercially successful single \"California Love\", which became both artists first song to top the Billboard Hot 100. However, in March 1996 Young left the label amidst a contract dispute and growing concerns that label boss Suge Knight was corrupt, financially dishonest and out of control. Later that year, he formed his own label, Aftermath Entertainment, under the distribution label for Death Row Records, Interscope Records. Subsequently, Death Row Records suffered poor sales by 1997, especially following the death of 2Pac and the racketeering charges brought against Knight. Dr. Dre also appeared on the single \"No Diggity\" by R&B group Blackstreet in 1996: it too was a sales success, topping the Hot 100 for four consecutive weeks, and later won the award for Best R&B Vocal by a Duo or Group at the 1997 Grammy Awards. After hearing it for the first time, several of Dr. Dre former Death Row colleagues, including 2Pac, recorded and attempted to release a song titled \"Toss It Up\", containing numerous insults aimed at Dr. Dre and using a deliberately similar instrumental to \"No Diggity\", but were forced to replace the production after Blackstreet issued the label with a cease and desist order stopping them from distributing the song.  1996–2000: Move to Aftermath Entertainment and 2001 The Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath album, released on November 26, 1996, featured songs by Dr. Dre himself, as well as by newly signed Aftermath Entertainment artists, and a solo track \"Been There, Done That\", intended as a symbolic farewell to gangsta rap. Despite being certified platinum by the RIAA, the album was not very popular among music fans. In October 1996, Dre performed \"Been There, Done That\" on Saturday Night Live. In 1997, Dr. Dre produced several tracks on the Firm The Album; it was met with largely negative reviews from critics. Rumors began to abound that Aftermath was facing financial difficulties. Aftermath Entertainment also faced a trademark infringement lawsuit by the underground thrash metal band Aftermath. First Round Knock Out, a compilation of various tracks produced and performed by Dr. Dre, was also released in 1996, with material ranging from World Class Wreckin Cru to N.W.A to Death Row recordings. Dr. Dre chose to take no part in the ongoing East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry of the time, instead producing for, and appearing on, several New York artists releases, such as Nas \"Nas Is Coming\", LL Cool J \"Zoom\" and Jay-Z \"Watch Me\". The turning point for Aftermath came in 1998, when Dre close friend, Jimmy Iovine, the co-founder of Interscope Records (parent label for Aftermath), suggested that Dr. Dre sign Eminem, a white rapper from Detroit. Dre produced three songs and provided vocals for two on Eminem successful and controversial debut album The Slim Shady LP, released in 1999. The Dr. Dre-produced lead single from that album, \"My Name Is\", brought Eminem to public attention for the first time, and the success of The Slim Shady LP – it reached number two on the Billboard 200 and received general acclaim from critics – revived the label commercial ambitions and viability.  Dr. Dre second solo album, 2001, released on November 16, 1999, was considered an ostentatious return to his gangsta rap roots. It was initially titled The Chronic 2000 to imply being a sequel to his debut solo effort The Chronic but was re-titled 2001 after Death Row Records released an unrelated compilation album with the title Suge Knight Represents: Chronic 2000 in May 1999. Other tentative titles included The Chronic 2001 and Dr. Dre. The album featured numerous collaborators, including Devin the Dude, Snoop Dogg, Kurupt, Xzibit, Nate Dogg, Eminem, Knoc-turnal, King T, Defari, Kokane, Mary J. Blige and new protégé Hittman, as well as co-production between Dre and new Aftermath producer Mel-Man. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of the website AllMusic described the sound of the album as \"adding ominous strings, soulful vocals, and reggae\" to Dr. Dre style. The album was highly successful, charting at number two on the Billboard 200 charts and has since been certified six times platinum, validating a recurring theme on the album: Dr. Dre was still a force to be reckoned with, despite the lack of major releases in the previous few years. The album included popular hit singles \"Still D.R.E.\" and \"Forgot About Dre\", both of which Dr. Dre performed on NBC Saturday Night Live on October 23, 1999. Dr. Dre won the Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical in 2000, and joined the Up in Smoke Tour with fellow rappers Eminem, Snoop Dogg, and Ice Cube that year as well.  2000–2010: Focus on production and Detox Following the success of 2001, Dr. Dre focused on producing songs and albums for other artists. He co-produced six tracks on Eminem landmark Marshall Mathers LP, including the Grammy-winning lead single, \"The Real Slim Shady\". The album itself earned a Grammy and proved to be the fastest-selling rap album of all time, moving 1.76 million units in its first week alone. He produced the single \"Family Affair\" by R&B singer Mary J. Blige for her album No More Drama in 2001. He also produced \"Let Me Blow Ya Mind\", a duet by rapper Eve and No Doubt lead singer Gwen Stefani and signed R&B singer Truth Hurts to Aftermath in 2001. Dr. Dre produced and rapped on singer and Interscope labelmate Bilal 2001 single \"Fast Lane\", which barely missed the Top 40 of the R&B charts. He later assisted in the production of Bilal second album, Love for Sale, which Interscope controversially shelved because of its creative direction. Dr. Dre was the executive producer of Eminem 2002 release, The Eminem Show. He produced three songs on the album, one of which was released as a single, and he appeared in the award-winning video for \"Without Me\". He also produced the D.O.C. 2003 album Deuce, where he made a guest appearance on the tracks \"Psychic Pymp Hotline\", \"Gorilla Pympin\" and \"Judgment Day\". In 2002, Dr. Dre signed rapper 50 Cent to Aftermath in a joint venture between Interscope and Eminem Shady Records. Dr. Dre served as executive producer for 50 Cent commercially successful February 2003 debut studio album Get Rich or Die Tryin. Dr. Dre produced or co-produced four tracks on the album, including the hit single \"In da Club\". Eminem fourth album since joining Aftermath, Encore, again saw Dre taking on the role of executive producer, and this time he was more actively involved in the music, producing or co-producing a total of eight tracks, including three singles. Dr. Dre also produced \"How We Do\", a 2005 hit single from rapper the Game from his album The Documentary, as well as tracks on 50 Cent successful second album The Massacre. For an issue of Rolling Stone magazine in April 2005, Dr. Dre was ranked 54th out of 100 artists for Rolling Stone magazine list \"The Immortals: The Greatest Artists of All Time\". Kanye West wrote the summary for Dr. Dre, where he stated Dr. Dre song \"Xxplosive\" as where he \"got (his) whole sound from\". In November 2006, Dr. Dre began working with Raekwon on his album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx II. He also produced tracks for the rap albums Buck the World by Young Buck, Curtis by 50 Cent, Tha Blue Carpet Treatment by Snoop Dogg, and Kingdom Come by Jay-Z. Dre also appeared on Timbaland track \"Bounce\", from his 2007 solo album, Timbaland Presents Shock Value alongside, Missy Elliott, and Justin Timberlake. During this period, the D.O.C. stated that Dre had been working with him on his fourth album Voices through Hot Vessels, which he planned to release after Detox arrived. Planned but unreleased albums during Dr. Dre tenure at Aftermath have included a full-length reunion with Snoop Dogg titled Breakup to Makeup, an album with fellow former N.W.A member Ice Cube which was to be titled Heltah Skeltah, an N.W.A reunion album, and a joint album with fellow producer Timbaland titled Chairmen of the Board. In 2007, Dr. Dre third studio album, formerly known as Detox, was slated to be his final studio album. Work for the upcoming album dates back to 2001, where its first version was called \"the most advanced rap album ever\", by producer Scott Storch. Later that same year, he decided to stop working on the album to focus on producing for other artists, but then changed his mind; the album had initially been set for a fall 2005 release. Producers confirmed to work on the album include DJ Khalil, Nottz, Bernard \"Focus\" Edwards Jr., Hi-Tek, J.R. Rotem, RZA, and Jay-Z.  Snoop Dogg claimed that Detox was finished, according to a June 2008 report by Rolling Stone magazine. After another delay based on producing other artists work, Detox was then scheduled for a 2010 release, coming after 50 Cent Before I Self Destruct and Eminem Relapse, an album for which Dr. Dre handled the bulk of production duties. In a Dr Pepper commercial that debuted on May 28, 2009, he premiered the first official snippet of Detox. 50 Cent and Eminem asserted in a 2009 interview on BET 106 & Park that Dr. Dre had around a dozen songs finished for Detox. On December 15, 2008, Dre appeared in the remix of the song \"Set It Off\" by Canadian rapper Kardinal Offishall (also with Pusha T); the remix debuted on DJ Skee radio show. At the beginning of 2009, Dre produced, and made a guest vocal performance on, the single \"Crack a Bottle\" by Eminem and the single sold a record 418,000 downloads in its first week and reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart on the week of February 12, 2009. Along with this single, in 2009 Dr. Dre produced or co-produced 19 of 20 tracks on Eminem album Relapse. These included other hit singles \"We Made You\", \"Old Time Sake\", and \"3 a.m.\" (The only track Dre did not produce was the Eminem-produced single \"Beautiful\".). On April 20, 2010, \"Under Pressure\", featuring Jay-Z and co-produced with Scott Storch, was confirmed by Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre during an interview at Fenway Park as the album first single. The song leaked prior to its intended release in an unmixed, unmastered form without a chorus on June 16, 2010; however, critical reaction to the song was lukewarm, and Dr. Dre later announced in an interview that the song, along with any other previously leaked tracks from Detox recording process, would not appear on the final version of the album. Two genuine singles – \"Kush\", a collaboration with Snoop Dogg and fellow rapper Akon, and \"I Need a Doctor\" with Eminem and singer Skylar Grey – were released in the United States during November 2010 and February 2011 respectively: the latter achieved international chart success, reaching number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and later being certified double platinum by the RIAA and the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). On June 25, 2010, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers honored Dr. Dre with its Founders Award for inspiring other musicians.  2010–2020: The Planets, hiatus, Coachella, and Compton In an August 2010 interview, Dr. Dre stated that an instrumental album, The Planets, was in its first stages of production; each song being named after a planet in the Solar System. On September 3, Dr. Dre showed support to longtime protégé Eminem, and appeared on his and Jay-Z Home & Home Tour, performing hit songs such as \"Still D.R.E.\", \"Nuthin but a G Thang\", and \"Crack a Bottle\", alongside Eminem and another protégé, 50 Cent. Sporting an \"R.I.P. Proof\" shirt, Dre was honored by Eminem telling Detroit Comerica Park to do the same. They did so, by chanting \"DEEE-TOX\", to which he replied, \"Im coming!\" On November 14, 2011, Dre announced that he would be taking a break from music after he finished producing for artists Slim the Mobster and Kendrick Lamar. In this break, he stated that he would \"work on bringing his Beats By Dre to a standard as high as Apple\" and would also spend time with his family. On January 9, 2012, Dre headlined the final nights of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2012. In June 2014, Marsha Ambrosius stated that she had been working on Detox, but added that the album would be known under another title . In September 2014, Aftermath in-house producer Dawaun Parker confirmed the title change and stated that over 300 beats had been created for the album over the years, but few of them have had vocals recorded over them. The length of time that Detox had been recorded for, as well as the limited amount of material that had been officially released or leaked from the recording sessions, had given it considerable notoriety within the music industry. Numerous release dates (including the ones mentioned above) had been given for the album over the years since it was first announced, although none of them transpired to be genuine. Several musicians closely affiliated with Dr. Dre, including Snoop Dogg, fellow rappers 50 Cent, the Game and producer DJ Quik, had speculated in interviews that the album will never be released, due to Dr. Dre business and entrepreneurial ventures having interfered with recording work, as well as causing him to lose motivation to record new material. On August 1, 2015, Dre announced that he would release what would be his final album, titled Compton. It is inspired by the N.W.A biopic, Straight Outta Compton, and is a compilation-style album, featuring a number of frequent collaborators, including Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar, Xzibit and the Game, among others. It was initially released on Apple Music on August 7, with a retail version releasing on August 21. In an interview with Rolling Stone, he revealed that he had about 20 to 40 tracks for Detox but he did not release it because it did not meet his standards. Dre also revealed that he suffers from social anxiety and due to this, remains secluded and out of attention. On February 12, 2016, it was revealed that Apple would create its first original scripted television series for its then-upcoming Apple TV+ streaming service. Titled Vital Signs, it was set to reflect Dre life. He was also  an executive producer on the show before the show cancellation sometime in September 2018, due to an overly graphic concept of drugs, gun violence and sex. In October 2016, Sean Combs brought out Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and others on his Bad Boy reunion tour. In 2018, he produced four songs on Oxnard by Anderson .Paak. He was the executive producer on the album, as so its follow-up, 2019 Ventura.  2020–present: return to production and Super Bowl halftime show Dr. Dre was the executive producer of Eminem 2020 release, Music to Be Murdered By. He produced four songs on the album. He also produced two songs on the deluxe edition of the album, Side B, and appeared on the song, \"Gunz Blazing\". On September 30, 2021, it was revealed that Dre would perform at the Super Bowl LVI halftime show alongside Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, and Kendrick Lamar.  In December 2021, an update for the video game, Grand Theft Auto Online, predominantly featured Dre and added some of his previously unreleased tracks which was released as an EP, The Contract, on February 3, 2022. Around this time, Dre announced he was collaborating with Marsha Ambrosius on Casablanco, and with Mary J. Blige on an upcoming album. Later that year, Snoop Dogg announced that he and Dr. Dre are in the process of recording their new album, Missionary. Snoop said the album will be released via Death Row and Aftermath.  On February 13, 2022, Dr. Dre performed at the Super Bowl LVI halftime show alongside Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar, and Mary J. Blige, with surprise appearances from 50 Cent and Anderson. Paak. The performance was met with critical acclaim and is the first Super Bowl halftime show to win the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Live). The show also won the Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Production Design for a Variety Special and Outstanding Music Direction. The same year, he produced numerous songs including \"The King and I\", a collaboration between Eminem and CeeLo Green for the 2022 biopic, Elvis, and a remix of Kanye West song \"Use This Gospel\" for DJ Khaled album God Did.  In September 2022, it was reported that Dr. Dre will compose the original score for the upcoming animated series, Death for Hire: The Origin of Tehk City. The show is created by Ice-T and Arabian Prince; based on the graphic novel of the same title, it features the voice talent of Ice-T, his wife Coco Austin, Snoop Dogg, Busta Rhymes, and Treach among others. In February 2023, Dre and Marsha Ambrosius held a listening party for the Casablanco album in Los Angeles.  Other ventures Film appearances Dr. Dre made his first on screen appearance as a weapons dealer in the 1996 bank robbery movie Set It Off. In 2001, Dr. Dre also appeared in the movies The Wash and Training Day. A song of his, \"Bad Intentions\" (featuring Knoc-TurnAl and produced by Mahogany), was featured on The Wash soundtrack. Dr. Dre also appeared on two other songs \"On the Blvd.\" and \"The Wash\" along with his co-star Snoop Dogg.  Crucial Films In February 2007, it was announced that Dr. Dre would produce dark comedies and horror films for New Line Cinema-owned company Crucial Films, along with longtime video director Phillip Atwell. Dr. Dre announced \"This is a natural switch for me, since Ive directed a lot of music videos, and I eventually want to get into directing.\" Along with fellow member Ice Cube, Dr. Dre produced Straight Outta Compton (2015), a biographical film about N.W.A.  Entrepreneurship Beats Electronics In 2006, Dre co-founded Beats Electronics with his partner, Jimmy Iovine. Its first brand of headphones were launched in July 2008. The line consisted of Beats Studio, a circumaural headphone; Beats Tour, an in-ear headphone; Beats Solo & Solo HD, a supra-aural headphone; Beats Spin; Heartbeats by Lady Gaga, also an in-ear headphone; and Diddy Beats. In late 2009, Hewlett-Packard participated in a deal to bundle Beats By Dr. Dre with some HP laptops and headsets. HP and Dr. Dre announced the deal on October 9, 2009, at a press event. An exclusive laptop, known as the HP ENVY 15 Beats limited edition, was released for sale October 22. In January 2014, Beats Music was introduced and launched as a streaming service. Then, in May, technology giant Apple purchased the Beats brand for $3.4 billion. The deal made Dr. Dre the \"richest man in hip hop\". Dr. Dre became an Apple employee in an executive role, and worked with Apple for years. As of 2022, it was found that Apple had subtracted $200 million from the deal after entertainer Tyrese Gibson revealed the news of the acquisition on social media a month before it was completed without the company permission.  Philanthropy During May 2013, Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine donated a $70-million endowment to the University of Southern California to create the USC Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation. The goal of the academy has been stated as \"to shape the future by nurturing the talents, passions, leadership and risk-taking of uniquely qualified students who are motivated to explore and create new art forms, technologies, and business models.\" The first class of the academy began in September 2014. In June 2017, it was announced that Dr. Dre had committed $10 million to the construction of a performing arts center for the new Compton High School. The center will encompass creative resources and a 1,200-seat theater, and is expected to break ground in 2020. The project is a partnership between Dr. Dre and the Compton Unified School District.  Commercial endorsements In 2002 and 2003, Dr. Dre appeared in TV commercials for Coors Light beer. Beginning in 2009, Dr. Dre appeared in TV commercials that also featured his Beats Electronics product line. A 2009  commercial for the Dr Pepper soft drink had Dr. Dre DJing with Beats headphones and playing a brief snippet off the never-released Detox album. In 2010, Dr. Dre had a cameo in a commercial for HP laptops that featured a plug for Beats Audio. Then in 2011, the Chrysler 300S \"Imported from Detroit\" ad campaign had a commercial narrated by Dr. Dre and including a plug for Beats Audio.  Dr. Dre started Burning Man rumors An urban legend surfaced in 2011 when a Tumblr blog titled Dr. Dre Started Burning Man began promulgating the notion that the producer, rapper and entrepreneur had discovered Burning Man in 1995 during a music video shoot and offered to cover the cost of the event permit from the Nevada Bureau of Land Management under an agreement with the festival organizers that he could institute an entrance fee system, which had not existed before his participation. This claim was supported by an alleged letter from Dre to Nicole Threatt Young that indicated that Dre had shared his experience witnessing the Burning Man festival with her. Business Insider mentions the portion of the letter where Dr. Dre purportedly states \"someone should get behind this ... and make some money off these fools\" and compares Dr. Dre potential entrepreneurial engagement with Burning Man as a parallel to Steve Jobs efforts to centralize and profit from the otherwise unorganized online music industry. According to Salon, Dr. Dre ethos seems to be aligned with seven of the ten principles of the Burning Man community: \"radical self-reliance, radical self-expression, communal effort, civic responsibility, leaving no trace, participation and immediacy.\"  Musical influences and style The space, about the size of a college dorm room, is splattered with papers, ideas scribbled down in black ink. Nuthin but G thangs waiting to happen. Those that dont happen end up in a round, purple L.A. Lakers trash can. A kitchen, red and stainless steel like a 50s diner, adjoins the control room  Production style Dre is noted for his evolving production style, while always keeping in touch with his early musical sound and re-shaping elements from previous work. At the beginning of his career as a producer for the World Class Wreckin Cru with DJ Alonzo Williams in the mid-1980s, his music was in the electro-hop style pioneered by the Unknown DJ, and that of early hip-hop groups like the Beastie Boys and Whodini. From Straight Outta Compton on, Dre uses live musicians to replay old melodies rather than sampling them. With Ruthless Records, collaborators included guitarist Mike \"Crazy Neck\" Sims, multi-instrumentalist Colin Wolfe, DJ Yella and sound engineer Donovan \"The Dirt Biker\" Sound. Dre is receptive of new ideas from other producers, one example being his fruitful collaboration with Above the Law producer Cold 187um while at Ruthless. Cold 187 um was at the time experimenting with 1970s P-Funk samples (Parliament, Funkadelic, Bootsy Collins, George Clinton etc.), that Dre also used. Dre has since been accused of \"stealing\" the concept of G-funk from Cold 187 um. Upon leaving Ruthless and forming Death Row Records in 1991, Dre called on veteran West Coast DJ Chris \"the Glove\" Taylor and sound engineer Greg \"Gregski\" Royal, along with Colin Wolfe, to help him on future projects. His 1992 album The Chronic is thought to be one of the most well-produced hip-hop albums of all time. Musical themes included hard-hitting synthesizer solos played by Wolfe, bass-heavy compositions, background female vocals and Dre fully embracing 1970s funk samples. Dre used a minimoog synth to replay the melody from Leon Haywood 1972 song \"I Wanna Do Somethin Freaky to You\" for the Chronic first single \"Nuthin but a G Thang\" which became a global hit. For his new protégé Snoop Doggy Dogg album Doggystyle, Dre collaborated with then 19-year-old producer Daz Dillinger, who received co-production credits on songs \"Serial Killa\" and \"For all My Niggaz & Bitches\", The Dramatics bass player Tony \"T. Money\" Green, guitarist Ricky Rouse, keyboardists Emanuel \"Porkchop\" Dean and Sean \"Barney Rubble\" Thomas and engineer Tommy Daugherty, as well as Warren G and Sam Sneed, who are credited with bringing several samples to the studio. The influence of The Chronic and Doggystyle on the popular music of the 1990s went not only far beyond the West Coast, but beyond hip-hop as a genre. Artists as diverse as Master P (\"Bout It, Bout It\"), George Michael (\"Fastlove\"), Mariah Carey (\"Fantasy\"), Adina Howard (\"Freak Like Me\"), Luis Miguel (\"Dame\"), and The Spice Girls (\"Say Youll Be There\") used G-funk instrumentation in their songs. Bad Boy Records producer Chucky Thompson stated in the April 2004 issue of XXL magazine that the sound of Doggystyle and The Chronic was the basis for the Notorious B.I.G. 1995 hit single \"Big Poppa\":  At that time, we were listening to Snoop album. We knew what was going on in the West through Dr. Dre. Big just knew the culture, he knew what was going on with hip-hop. It was more than just New York, it was all over. In 1994, starting with the Murder was the Case soundtrack, Dre attempted to push the boundaries of G-funk further into a darker sound. In songs such as \"Murder was the Case\" and \"Natural Born Killaz\", the synthesizer pitch is higher and the drum tempo is slowed down to 91 BPM (87 BPM in the remix) to create a dark and gritty atmosphere. Percussion instruments, particularly sleigh bells, are also present. Dre frequent collaborators from this period included Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania natives Stuart \"Stu-B-Doo\" Bullard, a multi-instrumentalist from the Ozanam Strings Orchestra, Sam Sneed, Stephen \"Budda\" Anderson, and percussionist Carl \"Butch\" Small. This style of production has been influential far beyond the West Coast. The beat for the Houston-based group Geto Boys 1996 song \"Still\" follows the same drum pattern as \"Natural Born Killaz\" and Eazy E \"Wut Would U Do\" (a diss to Dre) is similar to the original \"Murder was the Case\" instrumental. This style of production is usually accompanied by horror and occult-themed lyrics and imagery, being crucial to the creation of horrorcore. By 1996, Dre was again looking to innovate his sound. He recruited keyboardist Camara Kambon to play the keys on \"Been There, Done That\", and through Budda and Sam Sneed he was introduced to fellow Pittsburgh native Melvin \"Mel-Man\" Bradford. At this time, he also switched from using the E-mu SP-1200 to the Akai MPC3000 drum kit and sampler, which he still uses today. Beginning with his 1996 compilation Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath, Dre production has taken a less sample-based approach, with loud, layered snare drums dominating the mix, while synthesizers are still omnipresent. In his critically acclaimed second album, 2001, live instrumentation takes the place of sampling, a famous example being \"The Next Episode\", in which keyboardist Camara Kambon re-played live the main melody from David McCallum 1967 jazz-funk work \"The Edge\". For every song on 2001, Dre had a keyboardist, guitarist and bassist create the basic parts of the beat, while he himself programmed the drums, did the sequencing and overdubbing and added sound effects, and later mixed the songs. During this period, Dre signature \"west coast whistle\" riffs are still present albeit in a lower pitch, as in \"Light Speed\", \"Housewife\", \"Some L.A. Niggaz\" and Eminem \"Guilty Conscience\" hook. The sound of \"2001\" had tremendous influence on hip-hop production, redefining the West Coast sound and expanding the G-funk of the early 1990s. To produce the album, Dre and Mel-Man relied on the talents of Scott Storch and Camara Kambon on the keys, Mike Elizondo and Colin Wolfe on bass guitar, Sean Cruse on lead guitar and sound engineers Richard \"Segal\" Huredia and Mauricio \"Veto\" Iragorri. From the mid-2000s, Dr. Dre has taken on a more soulful production style, using more of a classical piano instead of a keyboard, and having claps replace snares, as evidenced in songs such as Snoop Dogg \"Imagine\" and \"Boss Life\", Busta Rhymes \"Get You Some\" and \"Been Through the Storm\", Stat Quo \"Get Low\" and \"The Way It Be\", Jay-Z \"Lost One\", Nas \"Hustlers\", and several beats on Eminem Relapse album. Soul and R&B pianist Mark Batson, having previously worked with The Dave Matthews Band, Seal and Maroon 5 has been credited as the architect of this sound. Besides Batson, Aftermath producer and understudy of Dre, Dawaun Parker, who has named Q-Tip and J Dilla as his primary influences, is thought to be responsible for giving Dre newest beats an East Coast feel. Despite an occasional hint of trap about the beats and an intriguingly warped use of autotune in his Compton song, \"Darkside/Gone\", his production seems to stand slightly apart from current trends in hip-hop like Eminem song \"Little Engine\" with an ominous horrorcore beat — reminiscent of some of his works on Eminem album Relapse – or the West Coast joint Lock It Up.  Production equipment Dr. Dre has said that his primary instrument in the studio is the Akai MPC3000, a drum machine and sampler, and that he often uses as many as four or five to produce a single recording. He cites 1970s funk musicians such as George Clinton, Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield as his primary musical influences. Unlike most rap producers, he tries to avoid samples as much as possible, preferring to have studio musicians re-play pieces of music he wants to use, because it allows him more flexibility to change the pieces in rhythm and tempo. In 2001 he told Time magazine, \"I may hear something I like on an old record that may inspire me, but Id rather use musicians to re-create the sound or elaborate on it. I can control it better.\" Other equipment he uses includes the E-mu SP-1200 drum machine and other keyboards from such manufacturers as Korg, Rhodes, Wurlitzer, Moog, and Roland. Dr. Dre also stresses the importance of equalizing drums properly, telling Scratch in 2004 that he \"used the same drum sounds on a couple of different songs on one album before but youd never be able to tell the difference because of the EQ\".  Dr. Dre also uses the digital audio workstation Pro Tools and uses the software to combine hardware drum machines and vintage analog keyboards and synthesizers. After founding Aftermath Entertainment in 1996, Dr. Dre took on producer Mel-Man as a co-producer, and his music took on a more synthesizer-based sound, using fewer vocal samples (as he had used on \"Lil Ghetto Boy\" and \"Let Me Ride\" on The Chronic, for example). Mel-Man has not shared co-production credits with Dr. Dre since approximately 2002, but fellow Aftermath producer Focus has credited Mel-Man as a key architect of the signature Aftermath sound. In 1999, Dr. Dre started working with Mike Elizondo, a bassist, guitarist, and keyboardist who has also produced, written and played on records for female singers such as Poe, Fiona Apple and Alanis Morissette, In the past few years Elizondo has since worked for many of Dr. Dre productions. Dr. Dre also told Scratch magazine in a 2004 interview that he has been studying piano and music theory formally, and that a major goal is to accumulate enough musical theory to score movies. In the same interview he stated that he has collaborated with famed 1960s songwriter Burt Bacharach by sending him hip hop beats to play over, and hopes to have an in-person collaboration with him in the future.  Work ethic Dr. Dre has stated that he is a perfectionist and is known to pressure the artists with whom he records to give flawless performances. In 2006, Snoop Dogg told the website Dubcnn.com that Dr. Dre had made new artist Bishop Lamont re-record a single bar of vocals 107 times. Dr. Dre has also stated that Eminem is a fellow perfectionist, and attributes his success on Aftermath to his similar work ethic. He gives a lot of input into the delivery of the vocals and will stop an MC during a take if it is not to his liking. However, he gives MCs that he works with room to write lyrics without too much instruction unless it is a specifically conceptual record, as noted by Bishop Lamont in the book How to Rap. A consequence of his perfectionism is that some artists who initially sign deals with Dr. Dre Aftermath label never release albums. In 2001, Aftermath released the soundtrack to the movie The Wash, featuring a number of Aftermath acts such as Shaunta, Daks, Joe Beast and Toi. To date, none have released full-length albums on Aftermath and have apparently ended their relationships with the label and Dr. Dre. Other noteworthy acts to leave Aftermath without releasing albums include King Tee, 2001 vocalist Hittman, Joell Ortiz, Raekwon and Rakim.  Collaborators and co-producers Over the years, word of other collaborators who have contributed to Dr. Dre work has surfaced. During his tenure at Death Row Records, it was alleged that Dr. Dre stepbrother Warren G and Tha Dogg Pound member Daz made many uncredited contributions to songs on his solo album The Chronic and Snoop Doggy Dogg album Doggystyle (Daz received production credits on Snoop similar-sounding, albeit less successful album Tha Doggfather after Young left Death Row Records). It is known that Scott Storch, who has since gone on to become a successful producer in his own right, contributed to Dr. Dre second album 2001; Storch is credited as a songwriter on several songs and played keyboards on several tracks. In 2006 he told Rolling Stone:  \"At the time, I saw Dr. Dre desperately needed something,\" Storch says. \"He needed a fuel injection, and Dr. Dre utilized me as the nitrous oxide. He threw me into the mix, and I sort of tapped on a new flavor with my whole piano sound and the strings and orchestration. So Id be on the keyboards, and Mike [Elizondo] was on the bass guitar, and Dr. Dre was on the drum machine\". Current collaborator Mike Elizondo, when speaking about his work with Young, describes their recording process as a collaborative effort involving several musicians. In 2004 he claimed to Songwriter Universe magazine that he had written the foundations of the hit Eminem song \"The Real Slim Shady\", stating, \"I initially played a bass line on the song, and Dr. Dre, Tommy Coster Jr. and I built the track from there. Eminem then heard the track, and he wrote the rap to it.\" This account is essentially confirmed by Eminem in his book Angry Blonde, stating that the tune for the song was composed by a studio bassist and keyboardist while Dr. Dre was out of the studio but Young later programmed the song beat after returning. A group of disgruntled former associates of Dr. Dre complained that they had not received their full due for work on the label in the September 2003 issue of The Source. A producer named Neff-U claimed to have produced the songs \"Say What You Say\" and \"My Dad Gone Crazy\" on The Eminem Show, the songs \"If I Cant\" and \"Back Down\" on 50 Cent Get Rich or Die Tryin, and the beat featured on Dr. Dre commercial for Coors beer. Although Young studies piano and music theory, he serves as more of a conductor than a musician himself, as Josh Tyrangiel of Time magazine has noted:  Every Dre track begins the same way, with Dre behind a drum machine in a room full of trusted musicians. (They carry beepers. When he wants to work, they work.) Hell program a beat, then ask the musicians to play along; when Dre hears something he likes, he isolates the player and tells him how to refine the sound. \"My greatest talent,\" Dre says, \"is knowing exactly what I want to hear.\" Although Snoop Dogg retains working relationships with Warren G and Daz, who are alleged to be uncredited contributors on the hit albums The Chronic and Doggystyle, he states that Dr. Dre is capable of making beats without the help of collaborators, and that he is responsible for the success of his numerous albums. Dr. Dre prominent studio collaborators, including Scott Storch, Elizondo, Mark Batson and Dawaun Parker, have shared co-writing, instrumental, and more recently co-production credits on the songs where he is credited as the producer. Anderson .Paak also praised Dr. Dre in a 2016 interview with Music Times, telling the publication that it was a dream come true to work with Dre.  Ghostwriters It is acknowledged that most of Dr. Dre raps are written for him by others, though he retains ultimate control over his lyrics and the themes of his songs. As Aftermath producer Mahogany told Scratch: \"It like a class room in [the booth]. Hell have three writers in there. Theyll bring in something, hell recite it, then hell say, Change this line, change this word, like he grading papers.\" As seen in the credits for tracks Young has appeared on, there are often multiple people who contribute to his songs (although often in hip hop many people are officially credited as a writer for a song, even the producer). In the book How to Rap, RBX explains that writing The Chronic was a \"team effort\" and details how he ghostwrote \"Let Me Ride\" for Dre. In regard to ghostwriting lyrics he says, \"Dre doesnt profess to be no super-duper rap dude – Dre is a super-duper producer\". As a member of N.W.A, the D.O.C. wrote lyrics for him while he stuck with producing. Jay-Z ghostwrote lyrics for the single \"Still D.R.E.\" from Dr. Dre album 2001.  Personal life On December 15, 1981, when Dre was 16 years old and his then-girlfriend Cassandra Joy Greene was 15 years old, the two had a son named Curtis, who was brought up by Greene and first met Dre 20 years later. Curtis performed as a rapper under the name Hood Surgeon. In 1983, Dre and Lisa Johnson had a daughter named La Tanya Danielle Young. Dre and Johnson have three daughters together. In 1988, Dre and Jenita Porter had a son named Andre Young Jr. In 1990, Porter sued Dre, seeking $5,000 of child support per month. On August 23, 2008, Andre died at the age of 20 from an overdose of heroin and morphine at his mother Woodland Hills home. From 1987 to 1996, Dre dated singer Michelle, who frequently contributed vocals to Ruthless Records and Death Row Records albums. In 1991, they had a son named Marcel. In April 1992, after a verbal dispute with his engineer, Dre was consequently shot four times in his leg. On May 25, 1996, Dre married Nicole (née Plotzker) Threatt, who was previously married to basketball player Sedale Threatt. They have two children together: a son named Truice (born 1997) and a daughter named Truly (born 2001). In 2001, Dre earned a total of about US$52 million from selling part of his share of Aftermath Entertainment to Interscope Records and his production of such hit songs that year as \"Family Affair\" by Mary J. Blige. Rolling Stone magazine thus named him the second highest-paid artist of the year. Dr. Dre was ranked 44th in 2004 from earnings of $11.4 million, primarily from production royalties from such projects as albums from G-Unit and D12 and the single \"Rich Girl\" by singer Gwen Stefani and rapper Eve. Forbes estimated his net worth at US$270 million in 2012. The same publication later reported that he acquired US$110 million via his various endeavors in 2012, making him the highest–paid artist of the year. Income from the 2014 sale of Beats to Apple, contributing to what Forbes termed \"the biggest single-year payday of any musician in history\", made Dr. Dre the world richest musical performer of 2015. He remains one of the wealthiest musical artists. In 2014, Dre purchased a $40 million home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles from its previous owners, NFL player Tom Brady and supermodel Gisele Bündchen. It was reported that Dre suffered a brain aneurysm on January 5, 2021, and that he was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center ICU in Los Angeles, California. Hours after his admission to the hospital, Dre home was targeted for an attempted burglary. He eventually received support from LeBron James, Martin Lawrence, LL Cool J, Missy Elliott, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Ice Cube, 50 Cent, Ellen DeGeneres, Ciara, her husband Russell Wilson, T.I., Quincy Jones and others. In February, he was released with a following message on Instagram: \"Thanks to my family, friends and fans for their interest and well wishes. Im doing great and getting excellent care from my medical team. I will be out of the hospital and back home soon. Shout out to all the great medical professionals at Cedars. One Love!!\" In March 2024, Dre revealed that during his hospitalization following the brain aneurysm, he also suffered three strokes. In December 2021, Dre finalized his divorce from Nicole Threatt for a reported sum of $100 million of his estate. Dre is a fan of both the Los Angeles Rams of the NFL, and the Los Angeles Lakers of the NBA.  Controversies and legal issues Violence against women Dre has been accused of multiple incidents of violence against women. On January 27, 1991, at a music industry party at the Po Na Na Souk club in Hollywood, Dr. Dre assaulted television host Dee Barnes of the Fox television program Pump it Up!, following an episode of the show. Barnes had interviewed NWA, which was followed by an interview with Ice Cube in which Cube mocked NWA. Barnes filed a $22.7 million lawsuit in response to the incident. Subsequently, Dr. Dre was fined $2,500, given two years probation, ordered to undergo 240 hours of community service, and given a spot on an anti-violence public service announcement on television. The civil suit was settled out of court. Barnes stated that he \"began slamming her face and the right side of her body repeatedly against a wall near the stairway\". Dr. Dre later commented: \"People talk all this shit, but you know, somebody fucks with me, Im gonna fuck with them. I just did it, you know. Aint nothing you can do now by talking about it. Besides, it aint no big thing – I just threw her through a door.\" In March 2015, Michelle, the mother of one of Dre children, accused him of subjecting her to domestic violence during their time together as a couple, but did not initiate legal action. Their abusive relationship is portrayed in her 2016 biopic Surviving Compton: Dre, Suge & Michelle. Dre threatened a lawsuit against Lifetime, Sony Pictures and filmmakers of Surviving Compton in a cease and desist, but never ultimately took action. Interviewed by Ben Westhoff for the book Original Gangstas: the Untold Story of Dr Dre, Eazy-E, Ice Cube, Tupac Shakur, and the Birth of West Coast Rap, Lisa Johnson stated that Dre beat her many times, including while she was pregnant. She was granted a restraining order against him. Former labelmate Tairrie B claimed that Dre assaulted her at a post-Grammy party in 1990, in response to her track \"Ruthless Bitch\". During press for the 2015 film Straight Outta Compton, questions about the portrayal and behavior of Dre and other prominent figures in the rap community about violence against women – and the question about its absence in the film – were raised. The discussion about the film led to Dre addressing his past behavior in the press. In August 2015, in an interview with Rolling Stone, Dre lamented his abusive past, saying, \"I made some fucking horrible mistakes in my life. I was young, fucking stupid. I would say all the allegations arent true—some of them are. Those are some of the things that I would like to take back. It was really fucked up. But I paid for those mistakes, and there no way in hell that I will ever make another mistake like that again.\" In a statement to The New York Times on August 21, 2015, exactly two weeks after his album, Compton, was released, Dre again addressed his abusive past, stating, \"25 years ago I was a young man drinking too much and in over my head with no real structure in my life. However, none of this is an excuse for what I did. Ive been married for 19 years and every day Im working to be a better man for my family, seeking guidance along the way. Im doing everything I can so I never resemble that man again. ... I apologize to the women Ive hurt. I deeply regret what I did and know that it has forever impacted all of our lives.\" In the 2017 film The Defiant Ones, Dr. Dre explained about the Dee Barnes incident again, \"This was a very low point in my life. Ive done a lot of stupid shit in my life. A lot of things I wish I could go and take back. Ive experienced abuse. Ive watched my mother get abused. So there absolutely no excuse for it. No woman should ever be treated that way. Any man that puts his hands on a female is a fucking idiot. He out of his fucking mind, and I was out of my fucking mind at the time. I fucked up, I paid for it, Im sorry for it, and I apologize for it. I have this dark cloud that follows me, and it going to be attached to me forever. It a major blemish on who I am as a man.\"  Second divorce Dre wife, Nicole Plotzker-Young, filed for divorce in June 2020, citing irreconcilable differences. In November 2020, she filed legal claims that Dre engaged in verbal violence and infidelity during their marriage. She also stated that he tore up their prenuptial agreement that he wanted her to sign out of anger. Dre representative responded, calling her claims of infidelity and violence in their marriage \"false\".  Before being released from the Cedar-Sinai Medical Center, he was ordered to pay Plotzker-Young $2 million in temporary spousal support. Between the spring and summer of the year, Dre was ordered by the Los Angeles County judge to pay his ex-wife over $300,000 a month in spousal support. The $2 million extension request was also dismissed, due to insufficient claims.  In July 2021, Dr. Dre was ordered by the Los Angeles Superior Court Judge to pay an additional $293,306 a month to his estranged wife in spousal support starting August 1 until she decides to remarry or \"further order of the Court\". Then, in August, the judge denied his wife request for a protective order, due to her being afraid of Dre after a snippet leaked on Instagram of him rapping about the divorce proceedings and his possible brain aneurysm earlier that February; in this snippet, he called his wife a \"greedy bitch\".  In mid-October, Dr. Dre was served more divorce papers, during his grandmother funeral. That same month, Dre was officially deemed \"single\" by the judge. The financial owings in this case included expenses of Dre Malibu, Palisades and Hollywood Hills homes, but not his stock in past ownership of Beats Electronics, prior to its sale to Apple in 2014. In December 2021, the divorce proceedings entered their final stages. On December 28, the divorce was settled with Dre keeping most of his assets and income due to the prenuptial agreement, although he would have to pay a 9-figure settlement within one year.  Copyright lawsuits During the course of 2001 popularity, Dr. Dre was involved in several lawsuits. Lucasfilm Ltd., the film company behind the Star Wars film franchise, sued him over the use of the THX-trademarked \"Deep Note\". The Fatback Band also sued Dr. Dre over alleged infringement regarding its song \"Backstrokin\" in his song \"Let Get High\" from the 2001 album; Dr. Dre was ordered to pay $1.5 million to the band in 2003. French jazz musician Jacques Loussier sued Aftermath for $10 million in March 2002, claiming that the Dr. Dre-produced Eminem track \"Kill You\" plagiarized his composition \"Pulsion\". The online music file-sharing company Napster also settled a lawsuit with him and metal band Metallica in mid-2001, agreeing to block access to certain files that artists do not want to have shared on the network. Another copyright-related lawsuit hit Dr. Dre in the fall of 2002, when Sa Re Ga Ma, a film and music company based in Calcutta, India, sued Aftermath Entertainment over an uncredited sample of the Lata Mangeshkar song \"Thoda Resham Lagta Hai\" on the Aftermath-produced song \"Addictive\" by singer Truth Hurts. In February 2003, a judge ruled that Aftermath would have to halt sales of Truth Hurts album Truthfully Speaking if the company would not credit Mangeshkar.  Other On June 28, 1992, hours before midnight, a barbecue grill and an overfill of charcoal caused Dre Calabasas mansion to set on fire. Two firefighters who exhausted the fire were treated in the hospital for minor injuries. The fire caused over $125,000 in home damages. Dre pleaded guilty in October 1992 in a case of battery of a police officer and was convicted on two additional battery counts stemming from a brawl in the lobby of the New Orleans hotel in May 1991. In 1993, he was convicted of battery after an altercation with a man who stood outside the front porch of his Woodland Hills home in front of the musician girlfriend. He claimed that Dre broke his jaw as a result. On January 10, 1994, Dre was arrested after leading police on a 90 mph pursuit through Beverly Hills in his 1987 Ferrari. It was revealed that Dr. Dre had a blood alcohol of 0.16, twice the state of California legal limit. The conviction violated the conditions of parole following Dre battery conviction in 1993; he pleaded no contest and was sentenced to eight months in prison in September 1994. He was ordered to pay a $1,053 fine and attend an alcohol education program. In November 2004, at the Vibe magazine awards show in Los Angeles, Dr. Dre was attacked by a fan named Jimmy James Johnson, who was supposedly asking for an autograph. In the resulting scuffle, then-G-Unit rapper Young Buck stabbed the man. Johnson claimed that Suge Knight, president of Death Row Records, paid him $5,000 to assault Dre in order to humiliate him before he received his Lifetime Achievement Award. Knight immediately went on CBS The Late Late Show to deny involvement and insisted that he supported Dr. Dre and wanted Johnson charged. In September 2005, Johnson was sentenced to a year in prison and ordered to stay away from Dr. Dre until 2008. On October 30, 2015, Ruthless co-founder Jerry Heller filed suit against Dre, Ice Cube, Eazy-E widow, Tomica Woods-Wright, director F. Gary Gray and Universal Pictures for defamation of character and copyright infringement over the biopic, Straight Outta Compton. The lawsuit states that depictions of Heller in the film, portrayed by Paul Giamatti, were wrongfully taken from an autobiography he wrote about his involvement with Ruthless and N.W.A. The case was taken to court in June 2016 where a judge criticized the filing, saying that the film was \"approved to portray these facts in \"colorful and hyperbolic\" terms\". On September 2, 2016, Jerry Heller died of a car accident, preceded by a heart attack. However, his lawsuit kept on through his legal team and members of his estate. In October 2018, the lawsuit was dropped, costing Heller estate $35 million for punitive and $75 million for compensatory damages. On April 4, 2016, TMZ and the New York Daily News reported that Suge Knight had accused Dre and the Los Angeles Sheriff Department of a kill-for-hire plot in the 2014 shooting of Knight in club 1 OAK. Three months later, in July, Dre was reportedly detained by police after confronting a next-door neighbor in Malibu about a test drive. It was also alleged that he brandished a handgun on the neighbor, but no evidence would be linked and Dre was soon released. On May 8, 2018, Dre lost a name trademark filing to a Pennsylvania gynecologist named Draion Burch, who previously filed a trademark petition in 2015 to use his nickname, Dr. Drai, which has the similar pronunciation. Then, on June 26, Dre and Jimmy Iovine were ordered to pay $25 million to former partner and creative designer Steven Lamar, who sued the two co-founders for $100 million in unpaid royalties for designing the early Beats headphone models. The lawsuit was filed in 2015 after news broke out of Apple acquisition of the headphone brand a year prior. In August 2021, Dr. Dre oldest daughter LaTanya Young spoke out about being homeless and unable to support her four children. She is currently working for UberEats and DoorDash, and she also works at warehouse jobs. She is living in debt in her SUV while her children are living with friends.

              " 'Shawn Corey Carter (born December 4, 1969), known professionally as Jay-Z, is an American rapper and entrepreneur. Born and raised in New York City, he was named the greatest rapper of all time by Billboard and Vibe in 2023. He served as the president and chief executive officer of Def Jam Recordings from 2004 to 2007 before founding the entertainment company, Roc Nation the following year. As a protégé of fellow New York City-based rapper Jaz-O, Jay-Z began his musical career in the late 1980s; he co-founded the record label Roc-A-Fella Records in 1994 to release his first two studio albums Reasonable Doubt (1996) and In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997), both of which were met with critical acclaim. His following albums, including The Blueprint (2001), The Black Album (2003), American Gangster (2007), and 4:44 (2017) each debuted atop the Billboard 200; Jay-Z holds the record for the most number-one albums (14) of any solo artist on the chart. He has also released the collaborative albums The Best of Both Worlds (2002) and Unfinished Business (2004) with singer R. Kelly, Collision Course (2004) with Linkin Park, Watch the Throne (2011) with Kanye West, and Everything Is Love (2018) with his wife Beyoncé. He peaked the Billboard Hot 100 on four occasions with his guest performances on the singles \"Heartbreaker\" by Mariah Carey, \"Crazy in Love\" by Beyoncé, \"Umbrella\" by Rihanna, and his first to do so as a lead artist, \"Empire State of Mind\" (with Alicia Keys). Through his business ventures, Jay-Z became the first hip-hop billionaire in 2019. In 1999, he co-founded the clothing retailer Rocawear and later founded the 40/40 Club, a luxury bar chain, in 2003. As both grew into multi-million-dollar businesses, he launched Roc Nation, a multi-disciplinary entertainment agency in 2008. In 2015, he acquired the technology company Aspiro and led the expansion of Tidal, the company media streaming service. As of 2024, he is the wealthiest musical artist in the world with a net worth of US$2.5 billion. One of the world best-selling music artists with 140 million records sold, Jay-Z has won 24 Grammy Awards, the tenth-most of all time and most awarded for any hip hop artist jointly with Kanye West. He has been awarded the NAACP President Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, a Sports Emmy Award, and been nominated for a Tony Award. Ranked by Billboard and Rolling Stone as one of the 100 greatest artists of all time, Jay-Z was the first rapper to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the first solo living rapper inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2013.  Early life and education Shawn Corey Carter was born on December 4, 1969, in Brooklyn, New York City. He was raised in Marcy Houses, a public housing project in Brooklyn Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood. His father, Adnis Reeves, abandoned the family, and Jay-Z and his three older siblings were raised by his mother, Gloria Carter. Reeves later met and reconciled with Jay-Z prior to his death in 2003. Jay-Z claims in his lyrics that in 1982, at age 12, he shot his older brother in the shoulder for stealing his jewelry. He attended Eli Whitney High School and George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School, both in Brooklyn, and then Trenton Central High School in Trenton, New Jersey. He did not graduate, dropping out during his sophomore year at Trenton Central High School. According to his interviews and lyrics, he sold crack cocaine and was shot at three times during this period. His former friend was sentenced to prison for possessing drugs and weapons. Known as \"Jazzy\" around the neighborhood, he later adopted the stage name \"Jay-Z\" in homage to his mentor Jaz-O.  Career Jay-Z can be briefly heard on several of Jaz-O early recordings in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including \"H. P. Gets Busy\", \"The Originators\" and \"Hawaiian Sophie\". Jay-Z became embroiled in several battles with rapper LL Cool J in the early 1990s. He first became known to a wide audience on the posse cut \"Show and Prove\" on the 1994 Big Daddy Kane album Daddy Home. Jay-Z has been referred to as Big Daddy Kane hype man during this period, although Kane explains that he did not fill the traditional hype man role, and was instead basically making cameo appearances on stage. \"When I would leave the stage to go change outfits, I would bring out Jay-Z and Positive K and let them freestyle until I came back to the stage.\" According to his second verse on \"99 Problems\", released in 2003, Jay-Z was allegedly stopped by an NYPD detective in 1994 while en route to I-95, possibly for a search of drugs in his car. Detection dogs were called, but another police car had passed; Jay-Z was let go soon after. Jay-Z appeared on a popular song by Big L, \"Da Graveyard\", and on Mic Geronimo \"Time to Build\", which also featured early appearances by his former Murder Inc. colleagues Ja Rule and DMX in 1995. His first official rap single was \"In My Lifetime\", which was released with an accompanying music video in 1995. An unreleased music video was also produced for the B-side \"I Cant Get with That.\"  1995–2000: Reasonable Doubt, In My Lifetime, Vol. 1, Vol. 2..., Vol. 3..., and The Dynasty With no major label to give him a record deal, Jay-Z sold burned CDs out of his car, and with Damon \"Dame\" Dash and Kareem \"Biggs\" Burke, created Roc-A-Fella Records as an independent label in 1995. After striking a distribution deal with Priority, Jay-Z released his 1996 debut album Reasonable Doubt with beats from acclaimed producers such as DJ Premier and Super DJ Clark Kent and an appearance by The Notorious B.I.G. The album reached number 23 on the Billboard 200, and was generally favored by critics. This album would later be included in Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Albums of All Time as No. 248 and eventually reach platinum status. After reaching a new label distribution deal with Def Jam in 1997, Jay-Z released his follow-up In My Lifetime, Vol. 1. Featuring production by Sean \"Puff Daddy\" Combs, DJ Premier, and Ski, it earned platinum status in the United States. In 1998, Jay-Z released Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life which spawned the biggest hit of his career at the time, \"Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\". He relied more on flow and wordplay, and he continued with his penchant for mining beats from the popular producers of the day such as Swizz Beatz, an upstart in-house producer for Ruff Ryders, and Timbaland. Other producers included DJ Premier, Erick Sermon, The 45 King, and Kid Capri. Charting hits from this album included \"Can I Get A...\", featuring Ja Rule and Amil, and \"Nigga What, Nigga Who\", featuring Amil and Jaz-O. Vol. 2 would eventually become Jay-Z most commercially successful album; it was certified 5× Platinum in the United States and has to date sold over five million copies. The album went on to win a Grammy Award, although Jay-Z boycotted the ceremony protesting DMX failure to garner a Grammy nomination and the academy decision to not broadcast urban music categories.  In 1999, Jay-Z collaborated with Mariah Carey on \"Heartbreaker\", a song from her seventh album, Rainbow. The song became Jay-Z first chart-topper in the US, spending two weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100. In that same year, Jay-Z released Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter. The album proved successful and sold over 3 million copies. Vol. 3 most successful single was \"Big Pimpin\", featuring UGK. In 2000, Jay-Z released The Dynasty: Roc La Familia, which was originally intended to become a compilation album for Roc-A-Fella artists but Def Jam turned into a Jay-Z album. The album helped to introduce newcomer producers The Neptunes, Just Blaze, Kanye West, and Bink, which have all gone on to achieve notable success. This is also the first album where Jay-Z utilizes a more soulful sound than his previous albums. The Dynasty sold over two million units in the U.S. alone.  2001–2002: Feud with Nas, The Blueprint and The Blueprint2 In 2001, Jay-Z spoke out against Prodigy after he took an issue with a Jay-Z line from \"Money, Cash, Hoes\" that he felt alluded disparagingly to Mobb Deep and Prodigy dispute with Tupac Shakur, Snoop Dogg, and Death Row Records. He later performed the song \"Takeover\", at Summer Jam 2001, which initially attacked Prodigy and revealed photos of Prodigy dressed like Michael Jackson. A line at the end of \"Takeover\" referred to Nas, who criticized him on \"We Will Survive\". Nas responded with a diss track called \"Ether\" and Jay-Z straightaway added a verse to \"Takeover\" which dissed Nas and would start a feud between the two rappers. The feud had ended by 2005; Jay-Z stated that record producer Mark Pitts had helped them settle their differences. On September 11, 2001, Jay-Z released his sixth studio album, The Blueprint, which received a five-mic review from hip-hop magazine The Source. Written in just two days, the album sold more than 427,000 copies, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached double platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. Eminem guest performed and produced its song, \"Renegade\". Four tracks were produced by Kanye West. The Blueprint includes the songs \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.)\", \"Girls, Girls, Girls\", \"Jigga That Nigga\", and \"Song Cry\". As of February 2012, the album had sold 2.7 million copies worldwide. In 2019, The Blueprint was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In October 2001, Jay-Z pleaded guilty to aggravated assault for stabbing record producer Lance Rivera at the Kit Kat Klub in New York City in 1999. Despite Jay-Z sentence of three years probation for the crime, Rivera later recanted the allegations in 2023. Jay-Z then collaborated with Chicago singer R. Kelly to release collaborative studio album, The Best of Both Worlds in March 2002. In November of that year, Jay-Z released his seventh studio album The Blueprint2: The Gift & The Curse—a double album. The album debuted on the Billboard 200 at number one, selling over 3 million units solely in the U.S. and surpassing The Blueprint. It yielded a single-disc re-issue, The Blueprint 2.1, which retained half of the songs from the original. Its original release spawned two hit singles, \"Excuse Me Miss\" and \"03 Bonnie & Clyde\", which features Jay-Z then-girlfriend, Beyoncé, and contained the track \"A Dream\", featuring Faith Evans and the late Notorious B.I.G.; the re-issue spawned the single \"La-La-La\", which was a sequel to \"Excuse Me Miss\" and failed to match its commercial success.  2003–2005: The Black Album and initial retirement After visiting the south of France, Jay-Z announced work on his eighth studio album, The Black Album at the opening of the 40/40 Club. He worked with several producers including Just Blaze, The Neptunes, Kanye West, Timbaland, Eminem, DJ Quik, 9th Wonder, The Buchanans, and Rick Rubin. Notable songs on the album included \"What More Can I Say\", \"Dirt off Your Shoulder\", \"Change Clothes\", and \"99 Problems\". The Black Album has sold over 3 million copies in the U.S. On November 25, 2003, Jay-Z held a concert—billed as a \"retirement party\" at Madison Square Garden in New York City, which was later the focus of his 2004 documentary, Fade to Black. All proceeds went to charity. Other performers included collaborators the Roots (in the form of his backing band), Missy Elliott, Memphis Bleek, Beanie Siegel, Freeway, Mary J. Blige, Beyoncé, Twista, Ghostface Killah, Foxy Brown, Pharrell Williams and R. Kelly, with appearances by Voletta Wallace and Afeni Shakur, the mothers of the Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur, respectively. While Jay-Z had attested to a retirement from making new studio albums, various side projects and appearances soon followed. Included in these were a greatest hits record, as well as the release and tour of Unfinished Business, the second collaborative album between Jay-Z and R. Kelly. In 2004, Jay-Z collaborated with rock group Linkin Park, in which they released their collaborative remix EP Collision Course, which featured mashups of both artists songs, as well as a concert DVD. The album only single, \"Numb/Encore\", went on to win a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration, and was performed with Linkin Park live at the Grammys, with a special appearance by Paul McCartney, who added verses from the song \"Yesterday\". The EP sold over 1 million copies in the U.S. Jay-Z was the executive producer of The Rising Tied, the debut album of Fort Minor, the hip hop side project of Linkin Park rapper Mike Shinoda. Jay-Z also planned to retire in 2004. Later in 2004, Jay-Z was named president of Def Jam Records, which led to Jay-Z, Dash and Biggs selling their remaining interests in Roc-A-Fella Records and Jay-Z taking control of both of the companies. Reportedly this major industry move was prompted by disagreements between Jay-Z and Dash as to what direction Roc-A-Fella could undertake.  2005–2007: Kingdom Come and American Gangster On October 27, 2005, Jay-Z headlined New York Power 105.1 annual concert, Powerhouse. The concert was entitled the \"I Declare War\" concert leading to intense speculation in the weeks preceding the event on whom exactly Jay-Z would declare war. As he had previously \"declared war\" on other artists taking lyrical shots at him at other events, many believed that the Powerhouse show would represent an all-out assault by Jay-Z upon his rivals. The theme of the concert was Jay-Z position as president and CEO of Def Jam, complete with an on-stage mock-up of the Oval Office. Many artists made appearances such as the old roster of Roc-A-Fella records artists, as well as Ne-Yo, Teairra Marí, T.I., Young Jeezy, Akon, Kanye West, Paul Wall, The LOX, and Diddy. At the conclusion of the concert, Jay-Z put many arguments to rest to the surprise of hip hop fans. The most significant development in this show was closure to the infamous hip hop rivalry between Jay-Z and Nas. The two former rivals shook hands and shared the stage together to perform Jay-Z \"Dead Presidents\" blended with Nas song \"The World is Yours\". Jay-Z returned with his comeback album on November 21, 2006, titled Kingdom Come. Jay-Z comeback single, \"Show Me What You Got\", was leaked on the Internet in early October 2006, scheduled to be released later on that month, received heavy air-play after its leak, causing the FBI to step in and investigate. Jay-Z worked with video director Hype Williams, and the single video was directed by F. Gary Gray. The album features production from Just Blaze, Pharrell, Kanye West, Dr. Dre and Coldplay Chris Martin (single entitled \"Beach Chair\"). The first week saw 680,000 sales of the CD, enough to be his \"biggest sales week ever\" as Billboard reported. This album has sold 2 million copies in the U.S. Jay-Z released his tenth album entitled American Gangster on November 6, 2007. After viewing the Ridley Scott film of the same name, Jay-Z was heavily inspired to create a new \"concept\" album that depicts his experiences as a street-hustler. The album is not the film official soundtrack, although it was distributed by Def Jam. Jay-Z American Gangster depicts his life in correlation to the movie American Gangster. At the start of the album first single, \"Blue Magic\", Jay-Z offers a dealer manifesto while making references to political figures of the late 1980s with the lyric: \"Blame Reagan for making me to into a monster, blame Oliver North and Iran-Contra, I ran contraband that they sponsored, before this rhymin stuff we was in concert.\" Also notable about the \"Blue Magic\" music video was Jay-Z flashing €500 notes; Harvard Business School professor Rawi Abdelal called this a \"turning point in American pop culture response to globalization.\" The album has sold 1 million copies in the U.S. On January 1, 2008, Jay-Z resigned as president of Def Jam.  2008–2011: The Blueprint 3 and Watch the Throne In winter 2008, it was announced that Jay-Z would become the first major hip hop artist to headline Britain Glastonbury Festival. Tickets sold out quickly. Former headliner Noel Gallagher of Oasis condemned the festival organizers for choosing Jay-Z to headline a traditionally guitar-driven festival. \"Im sorry, but Jay-Z?\" Gallagher asked, swearing. \"No chance. Glastonbury has a tradition of, kind of, guitar music, do you know what I mean? And even when they throw the odd curve balls in on a Sunday night—you go, Kylie Minogue? I dont know about that, do you know what I mean?—but Im not having hip hop at Glastonbury, no way, no, no. It wrong.\" As controversy mounted, Jay-Z replied, \"We dont play guitars, Noel, but hip hop has put in its work like any other form of music. This headline show is just a natural progression. Rap music is still evolving. We have to respect each other genre of music and move forward.\" Jay-Z opened his Glastonbury set with a tongue-in-cheek cover of Oasis iconic song \"Wonderwall\", and went on to deliver a performance heralded as a successful response to pre-festival criticism. He also headlined many other summer festivals in 2008, including Roskilde Festival in Denmark, Hove Festival in Norway and O2 Wireless Festival in London. During Kanye West concert of August 6, 2008, at Madison Square Garden, Jay-Z came out to perform a new song and he and West proclaimed that it was to be on The Blueprint 3. On May 21, 2009, Jay-Z announced he would be parting ways with Def Jam, and had struck a multi-million-dollar deal to sign with Live Nation, with whom he would start his Roc Nation imprint which would serve as a record label, talent/management agency, and music publishing company and also partnered with production team Stargate to start a record label called StarRoc. Jay-Z 11th studio album The Blueprint 3 was originally to be released on September 11, 2009, but was instead released in North America on September 8, 2009, due to increasing anticipation. Its international release followed on September 14. It is his 11th album to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and has surpassed Elvis Presley previous record, making him the current solo-artist record holder. On October 9, 2009, Jay-Z kicked off his tour for The Blueprint 3, during which he supported his new album in North America. In a Shave Magazine review of his performance at Rexall Place in Edmonton, Jake Tomlinson expressed that \"It was the type of smooth performance you would expect from the hip-hop superstar.\" The review gave this performance 4 stars. His North American tour continued until November 22, 2009. At his concert on November 8, 2009, at UCLA Pauley Pavilion, Rihanna joined him on stage and performed \"Hard\" for the first time, then performed \"Run This Town\" with Jay-Z. Among his success, Jay-Z has ventured into producing Broadway shows. Along with Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith, Jay-Z helped produce the play Fela!, a musical celebrating the work of the late Nigerian star Fela Kuti. Jay-Z said he was inspired by the power of Kuti work and his life story, which resulted in his interest to help produce the musical. Fela! is a story about an African pioneer and political activist who made his first moves on the scene during the 1970s.  On January 23, 2010, Jay-Z released a track, \"Stranded (Haiti Mon Amour)\", with Rihanna, and U2 Bono and The Edge, as well as performing it at the Hope For Haiti Now telethon. In June 2010, Eminem and Jay-Z announced they would perform together in a pair of concerts in Detroit and New York. The event was dubbed The Home & Home Tour. The first two concerts rapidly sold out, prompting the scheduling of an additional show at each venue. Jay-Z was the supporting act for U2 on the Australian and New Zealand leg of their U2 360° Tour, beginning in Auckland, New Zealand, in November 2010, followed by Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth in December. Jay-Z also appeared on stage during U2 performances of \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", and in Auckland also on a five-track EP entitled Watch the Throne, although it was later revealed by West that the project had become a full-length LP. Recording sessions for the album took place at various recording locations and began in November 2010. The first single released for the project was \"H•A•M\". The track was co-produced by Lex Luger and West himself. The track ended up being on the deluxe edition of the album. The follow-up to that was the second single \"Otis\", which premiered on Funkmaster Flex Hot 97 radio show, and was later released to the iTunes Store eleven days later. The song existence, along with several other tracks from the album, was confirmed during a listening session hosted by Jay-Z. The album was first released on the iTunes Store, five days prior to its being released in physical format, a strategy Jay-Z later said was used to block an internet leak. It debuted at No. 1 on the iTunes Store in 23 countries. It also broke Coldplay record for most albums sold in one week on the online retailer, selling 290,000 copies on iTunes alone. It held that record until Lil Wayne Tha Carter IV was released twenty-one days later, selling 10,000 copies more. It debuted on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart at No. 1, selling 436,000 copies in its first week. The album received generally positive reviews. Jay-Z and West later gave a surprise performance of \"Otis\" at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards.  2012–2016: Magna Carta Holy Grail and other ventures Jay-Z collaborated with M.I.A on her single \"XXXO\", which achieved a fair level of success and went on to become remixed by several producers worldwide. In May 2012, Jay-Z and former Philadelphia mayor Michael A. Nutter announced Jay-Z as the curator and the headliner for the first annual \"Budweiser Made in America\" festival at Fairmount Park in Philadelphia on September 1 and 2, 2012. The performance was produced by Live Nation and assembled an eclectic lineup of \"rock, hip hop, R&B, Latin music and dance\" musicians. Jay-Z and Rihanna were the two main headlining acts for BBC Radio 1 2012 Hackney Weekend music festival on June 23 to 24. Jay-Z opened his set with an appearance from Rihanna, they performed \"Run this Town\". On September 6, \"Clique\" was released, a single from the album \"Cruel Summer\", by GOOD Music. Kanye West and Big Sean starred alongside Jay-Z on the track. Jay-Z took the subway to his sold-out show at The Barclays Center on October 6, 2012. On November 12, 2012, Coldplay announced that they will be playing with Jay-Z at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on December 31. On September 23, 2010, Q-Tip confirmed working on Jay-Z follow-up album to The Blueprint 3, saying the album was to hit stores by spring 2011. In May 2012 it was reported that Jay-Z would work on new music with Roc Nation producer Jahlil Beats. Beats told XXL magazine: \"Me and Jay-Z been going back and forth. He picked a couple of my joints that he working on. I dont even wanna say too much about Jay, but we definitely working on some stuff. I havent even sent him a bunch of beats. I sent him my favorite stuff. He hit me right back like, Yo, Ima go in on this, or, I like this.\" The album has been named one of the most anticipated albums of 2013 by Complex Magazine, MTV, and XXL. Production will come from Jahlil Beats, Kanye West, Rick Rubin, Swizz Beatz, Timbaland, and Pharrell Williams. Jay-Z also made an appearance on Justin Timberlake comeback single \"Suit & Tie\" from his third studio album The 20/20 Experience, the song itself was produced by both Jay-Z and Timberlake mutual friend, Timbaland. Timberlake and Jay-Z embarked on the co-headlining Legends of the Summer Stadium Tour. During the fifth game of the 2013 NBA Finals, Carter announced his twelfth studio album, Magna Carta Holy Grail, and was released on July 4, 2013. Not long after, Jay-Z confirmed that the hyphen in his stage name would be left out and officially stylized in all capital letters. Magna Carta Holy Grail debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and sold 528,000 copies in its first week, which bypassed its predicted debut in the range of 350,000 to 400,000. In December 2013, it was announced that Jay-Z had received nine nominations at the 2014 Grammy Awards, more than any other artist. Jay-Z appeared on his wife Beyoncé self-titled fifth studio album, Beyoncé, with a feature on the song \"Drunk in Love\". They performed this song together at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards opening. The song and its accompanying album would later win three Grammy Awards including Best R&B Performance at the 2015 ceremony. In 2016, he won a lawsuit for the song \"Made in America\" with Kanye West featuring Frank Ocean against Joel McDonald.  Since 2017: 4:44 and Everything Is Love In early June 2017, posters were displayed in New York City and Los Angeles, and banner ads were placed on the Internet promoting a Tidal-related project titled 4:44. A teaser ad was aired during the NBA Finals on June 7 featuring actors Mahershala Ali, Lupita Nyongo and Danny Glover in a one-minute video, ending in \"4:44 – 6.30.17, Exclusively on Tidal\". On June 18, the project was confirmed to be a new Jay-Z album, and a clip featuring a song titled \"Adnis\" was posted on Sprint YouTube page. 4:44 was released through Roc Nation and Universal Music Group, as an exclusive to Sprint and Tidal customers. The album is the first in a planned series of music exclusives from the Sprint–Tidal partnership. For a short time, on July 2, the album was made available for free digital download in Tidal site. A physical edition was released on July 7, including three additional tracks. On the same day, the album was made available to other streaming platforms, such as Apple Music, Google Play Music and Amazon Music. The album received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its emotional and personal content. On July 5, the album was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), in recognition of one million copies purchased by Sprint and offered to consumers as free downloads. It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, making it Jay-Z 13th consecutive studio album to top the chart. The album spawned two singles, the title track \"4:44\" and \"Bam\", as well as several music videos, directed by a variety of high-profile collaborators. The album received a Grammy Award nomination for Album of the Year, while the title track was nominated for Song of the Year and \"The Story of O.J.\" was nominated for Record of the Year at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards. On June 6, 2018, Jay-Z and Beyoncé kicked-off the On the Run II Tour in Cardiff, United Kingdom. Ten days later, at their final London performance, the pair unveiled Everything Is Love, their much-awaited joint studio album, credited under the name The Carters. The pair also released the video for the album lead single, \"Apeshit\", on Beyoncé official YouTube channel. The song won two awards from eight nominations at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards. In 2021, Jay-Z was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame along with fellow rapper LL Cool J. He also appeared on the song \"Jail\" on Kanye West 2021 album Donda, which went on to win Grammy Award for Best Rap Song at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards and on the song \"Love All\" from Drake 2021 album Certified Lover Boy. In 2022, his first feature was a collaboration with fellow rapper Pusha T, \"Neck & Wrist\" featuring Pharrell Williams from Pusha T album, It Almost Dry. His feature was succeeded by a four-minute guest appearance on DJ Khaled album title track, \"God Did\". He also was awarded the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Live), as a producer for the Super Bowl LVI halftime show.  Musical style Influences Jay-Z says his earliest exposure to music was through his parents record collection, which was mostly of soul artists such as Marvin Gaye and Donny Hathaway. He says \"I grew up around music, listening to all types of people... Im into music that has soul in it, whether it be rap, R&B, pop music, whatever. As long as I can feel their soul through the wax, that what I really listen to.\" He often uses excerpts from these artists as samples in his work, particularly in the Kanye West productions included on The Blueprint.  Rapping technique Royce da 59\" and Fredro Starr of Onyx both describe Jay-Z emphasis on flow in the book How to Rap—Starr says that Jay-Z is \"a master of the flow—he can flow fast, he can flow slow\". The book describes how Jay-Z uses rests to provide structure to a verse and how he uses partial linking to add more rhymes to a verse. Jay-Z early style is described by Vibe as \"a distinctly Das EFX-type, stiggety style\" on his 12\" single \"Cant Get With That\", referring to the fast rhythms and vocal delivery of the group Das EFX. He is also known to write lyrics in his head, as described by Pusha T of Clipse in How to Rap, a style popular with many MCs such as The Notorious B.I.G., Everlast, Bobby Creekwater and Guerilla Black. Shock G of Digital Underground describes Jay-Z live performance style, saying he \"rarely breaks a sweat, and instead uses smoothness and clever wordplay to keep the audience interested and entertained\". Jay-Z fast rapping technique, also known as the \"triplet rhyme\", was developed during his early years of creating music with former mentor Jaz-O.  Business career Jay-Z has also established himself as a successful entrepreneur with a business empire spanning a variety of industries from clothing lines, beverages, real estate, sport teams, and record labels. In an interview, he stated that \"my brands are an extension of me. Theyre close to me. It not like running GM, where there no emotional attachment.\"  Rocawear Jay-Z and Damon Dash are the founders of the urban clothing brand Rocawear. Rocawear has clothing lines and accessories for men, women and children. The line was taken over by Jay-Z in early 2006 following a falling out with Dash. In March 2007, Jay-Z sold the rights to the Rocawear brand to Iconix Brand Group for $204 million. He retains his stake in the company and continues to oversee the marketing, licensing and product development.  Reebok Jay-Z became the first rapper in Reebok history to endorse the company footwear, signing a three-year endorsement deal. He later appeared in a 2003 Reebok collection advertising his S. Carter Collection. Later that year, he and frenemy 50 Cent appeared in a commercial to promote their S. Carter and G-Unit footwears for the company, with a Just Blaze-produced song made for it. In 2006, Jay-Z deal with Reebok expired with no renewal.  Alcoholic beverages In 2014, Jay-Z invested $200 million in Armand de Brignac champagne—owned at the time by Sovereign Brands, a New York–based wine and spirits company—for a 100 percent stake, making it the second alcoholic product acquisition in his financial investment portfolio. The brand is known for its popularity with high-profile artists as being the gold bottles often referred to in media. His ties to the company date back to 2006, and he received millions of dollars per year for his association with Armand de Brignac before he bought the entire company. Jay-Z serves as co-brand director for Budweiser Select and collaborates with the company on strategic marketing programs and creative ad development. He provides direction on brand programs and ads that appear on TV, radio, print, and high-profile events.  Technology In March 2015, Jay-Z completed the $56 million acquisition of Aspiro, a Norwegian media technology company that operates the subscription-based music streaming service Tidal, which has been in operation since October 2014. The music service was acquired through his company Project Panther Bidco Ltd. (an entity indirectly owned by Jay-Z S. Carter Enterprises a company holding interests in leading international music, media and entertainment companies). The music service combines audio and music videos with curated editorial. The main idea of the service is to bring major revenue streams back to the music artists themselves as the idea of an artist-owned streaming platform was stated as to \"restore the value to music by launching a service owned by artists.\" Jay-Z currently is a major shareholder in the company. In July 2015, Carter made a significant investment to JetSmarter, an app helping people book private executive plane flights. The app was built by Sergey Petrossov.  Music industry From 2005 to 2007, Jay-Z was inaugurated as the president of Def Jam Recordings. Under Jay-Z leadership, Def Jam launched the successful careers of contemporary R&B singers Rihanna and Ne-Yo. At the end of 2007, after he released American Gangster, Jay-Z decided not to renew his contract as the president and CEO of Def Jam. Shortly after, he started his Live Nation venture, Roc Nation. In April 2011, it was reported that Jay-Z had outbid executives at Universal Music and Jive Records to acquire independent record label Block Starz Music.  Sporting business For a decade (2003–2013), Jay-Z enjoyed his role as a part-owner of the Brooklyn Nets NBA team, having paid a reported $1 million for his share, which declined in value to $350,000 in April 2013, based on Forbes magazine valuation of the team. He encouraged the team relocation to Brooklyn Barclays Center (from New Jersey) in the 2012–2013 season, at which point the team took on the Brooklyn Nets moniker. On April 18, 2013, Jay-Z officially announced through his Life + Times website in a press release that he would be relinquishing his ownership in the Brooklyn Nets. The shares were eventually sold to singer, rapper, actor and entrepreneur Will Pan, making Pan the first American of Taiwanese descent to own a U.S. professional sports franchise. Jay-Z cited Pan athletic background (he was a team captain of his high school basketball team and played in college), his multitude of musical styles, his influence in the Taiwanese American community, and his business acumen and portfolio (including being the founder and chief executive of software company Camigo Media and a co-founder of streetwear boutique N.P.C [New Project Center]), as reasons why his bid was successful. In September 2013, his stake in Barclays Center was sold for $1.5 million. On April 2, 2013, ESPN reported Jay-Z plans to launch his own sports agency, Roc Nation Sports, with a focus on the representation of various professional athletes. The sport management group is a partnership with Creative Artists Agency.  In conjunction with the agency launch, New York Yankees second baseman Robinson Canó left agent Scott Boras to sign with the company. ESPN also mentioned that Jay-Z himself was planning to be a certified sports agent, first in baseball and eventually in basketball and football. In order to represent clients in basketball, he would have to give up his small share of the Brooklyn Nets. In October 2005, he was reported in English media as considering buying a stake of Arsenal F.C., an English soccer team. Through his conglomerate company Gain Global Investments Network LLC, he had an interest estimated between 2 and 7% in the Aqueduct Entertainment Group (AEG) consortium, which in January 2010 was awarded a contract to operate a 4,500-slot-machine racino at the Aqueduct Race Track. Jay-Z became interested in the project after New York Governor David Paterson who awarded the contract said there had to be an affirmative action component to the ownership. Jay-Z was initially approached by casino mogul Steve Wynn, who was also bidding on the contract. On March 9, 2010, Jay-Z and Flake withdrew from the project, and Paterson recused himself from further involvement.  Media On April 5, 2011, Jay-Z launched the popular culture and lifestyle online magazine Life + Times. It features content that showcases his high-end tastes in clothing, appliances, and cars. The site design is aesthetically aimed at the upwardly mobile young male demographic, with sports and music-related posts accompanying those about fashion and design. Among the music content is the Decoded series, originating from Jay-Z memoir of the same name and featuring a select rapper deciphering their own lyrics. In January 2015, after being contacted by the webzine, the DJ and radio host Funkmaster Flex revealed that he had been contacted in 2013 for a story about a digital app he made at the time, but alleged that the information was instead used to help launch the Magna Carta Samsung app for the release of Jay-Z album of the same name. \"But I was good with that. I ate that. Everybody out here hustling\", Flex reasoned to Vibe. In 2016, he signed a two-year exclusive film and TV Deal with Weinstein Company and with the deal gives them first-look options to create scripted and unscripted TV projects and film projects, and those projects were in works. As part of his deal with Weinstein company, he produced a documentary series on the life of Kalief Browder who was imprisoned for three years and committed suicide upon his release. He also addressed racial profiling and police brutality in a conscious manner.  Other ventures Jay-Z also co-owns the 40/40 Club, an upscale sports bar that started in New York City, and has since expanded to Atlantic City and Chicago. In 2008, the 40/40 Club in Las Vegas was closed down and bought back by the hotel after attendance steadily declined. In 2005, Jay-Z became an investor in Carol Daughter, a line of beauty products, including products for hair, skin, and hands. In 2010, he announced plans to expand his 40/40 Club sports bar chain into as many as 20 airports, joining his Roc Nation business partners, husband and wife Juan and Desiree Perez, in a deal with Delaware North. On November 16, 2010, Jay-Z published a memoir entitled Decoded. The memoir was co-signed by Dream Hampton. Parlux fragrances sued Jay-Z for $18 million for the failure of his cologne, Gold. They claim the cologne failure is due to Jay-Z not doing social media posts and interviews about the cologne. Parlux claims they projected selling $15 million the first year, and $35 million the second, and subsequent years after the launch. The fragrance sold $14 million the first year and $6.1 million the second. Parlux lost money on the venture and have had constant returns of unsold inventory. Jay-Z collaborated with Cohiba to launch his own cigars. In August 2020, Jay-Z Roc Nation partnered with Brooklyn Long Island University to establish the Roc Nation School of Music, Sports & Entertainment. In November 2020, it was announced that Jay-Z would be join TPCO Holding Corp., a newly formed cannabis products company, in the role of \"Chief Visionary Officer\". On December 5, 2022, Jay-Z and the Roc Nation announced their partnership with Caesars Entertainment to build and operate a casino property at Times Square.  Personal life In 2002, Jay-Z and singer Beyoncé collaborated on the song \"03 Bonnie & Clyde\". He also appeared on Beyoncé hit single, \"Crazy in Love\" the following year, as well as the song \"That How You Like It\" from her debut album Dangerously in Love (2003). On her second album, BDay, he made appearances on the hits \"Déjà Vu\" and \"Upgrade U\". In the video for the latter song, she comically imitates his appearance. They kept a low profile while dating, and were married on April 4, 2008, in a private ceremony in Tribeca, New York City. Their relationship became a matter of public record on April 22, 2008, although Beyoncé did not publicly debut her US$5 million Lorraine Schwartz-designed wedding ring until the Fashion Rocks concert on September 5, 2008. Since their marriage, they generally avoid discussing their relationship, and Beyoncé has stated her belief that this has helped them, while Jay-Z agreed in a People article that they do not \"play with [their] relationship\". In 2006, Beyoncé and Jay-Z were listed as the most powerful couple for Time magazine 100 most influential people. In January 2009, Forbes ranked them as Hollywood top-earning couple, with a combined total of $162 million. They made it to the top of the list the following year, with a combined total of US$122 million between June 2008 and June 2009. At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé revealed that she was pregnant with their first child. Their daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, was born at New York Lenox Hill Hospital on January 7, 2012. Jay-Z released \"Glory\", a song dedicated to Blue Ivy, through his Life+Times website on January 9, 2012. The song, produced by frequent collaborators the Neptunes, detailed the couple pregnancy struggles, including a miscarriage Beyoncé had suffered. Blue Ivy cries were included at the end of the song, and she was officially credited on the song as \"B.I.C\"; she became the youngest person in Billboard history (at two days old) have a chart entry when \"Glory\" debuted at No. 74 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. On June 18, 2017, Beyoncé father Mathew Knowles confirmed that she had given birth to twins with Jay-Z, a daughter named Rumi and a son named Sir. In the following months, they purchased a US$88 million home in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles. In 2023, the couple bought a house in Malibu, California, designed by the architect Tadao Ando, for $200 million. It established a record for the most expensive residence sold in California.  Legal issues On December 2, 1999, Jay-Z, who had come to believe that record executive Lance \"Un\" Rivera was behind the bootlegging of Vol. 3..., allegedly stabbed him at the Kit Kat Klub, a now-defunct night club in Times Square, New York City, during a release party for Q-Tip album Amplified. Jay-Z associates at the party were accused of causing a commotion within the club, which Jay-Z allegedly used as cover while he stabbed Rivera in the stomach with a five-inch (127 mm) blade. He surrendered to police the following evening and was placed under arrest, although he was soon released on $50,000 bail. When he was indicted in Manhattan Criminal Court in late January 2000, he pleaded not guilty; he and his lawyers contended that they had witnesses and videotapes proving he had been nowhere near Rivera during the incident. Nevertheless, he later pleaded guilty to third-degree assault and accepted a three-year probation sentence. Jay-Z later addressed the case in his 2010 book Decoded:  One night I went to Q-Tip solo album release party and at some point in the night, I ran into the guy everyone been telling me is behind the bootleg. So I approached him. When I told him what I suspected, to my surprise, he got real loud with me right there in the middle of the club. It was strange. We separated and I went over to the bar. I was sitting there like, \"No the fuck this nigga did not...\" I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. The next thing I knew, all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted. [...] There was no reason to put my life on the line, and the lives of everyone who depends on me, because of a momentary loss of control. [...] I vowed to never allow myself to be in a situation like that again. In 2023, Rivera stated that Jay-Z lied, and was not the one that stabbed him: “No. Jay-Z was not the guy that actually stabbed me that night (...) it’s never been his history”.  Philanthropy During his first retirement from music, Jay-Z became involved in philanthropy. In 2003, along with his mother, Jay-Z founded the Shawn Carter Foundation, which assists eligible students facing socio-economic hardships attend and get through college. In August 2006, he met with Kofi Annan, then Secretary-General of the United Nations at the organization New York City headquarters, where he pledged to use his upcoming world tour to raise awareness of the global water shortage, a challenge he learned about following a visit to Africa by Bono, the lead singer of U2. The effort took place in partnership with the UN, as well as MTV, which produced a documentary entitled Diary of Jay-Z: Water for Life, first airing in November 2006. Along with Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, Jay-Z pledged $1 million to the American Red Cross relief effort after Hurricane Katrina. Jay-Z supported Kanye West after West outburst against President George W. Bush during a live Katrina charity telethon. He also addressed the Katrina disaster and the federal government response in his one-verse song \"Minority Report\". Jay-Z has said that \"the greatest form of giving is anonymous to anonymous\". In 2013, author dream hampton, who co-wrote Jay-Z book Decoded, revealed that Jay-Z had established a trust fund for Sean Bell children. Jay-Z donated to bail out protestors arrested during 2015 activism against police brutality. In March 2020, Jay-Z donated $1 million through the Shawn Carter Foundation to aid in relief during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York. In April 2020, along with Meek Mill, he donated over 100,000 face masks to U.S. prisons to assist in protecting prison inmates from COVID-19.  Political involvement In 2006, Jay-Z appeared with Russell Simmons in a public service announcement denouncing racism and anti-Semitism, sponsored by the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding. In 2008, Jay-Z was  involved in the 2008 United States presidential election, supporting enhanced voter participation. He supported the 2008 presidential candidacy of Barack Obama and performed voter-drive concerts financed by the Democrats campaign. He also became acquainted with Obama, who in June 2008 said, \"Every time I talk to Jay-Z, who is a brilliant talent and a good guy, I enjoy how he thinks. That somebody who is going to start branching out and can help shape attitudes in a real positive way.\" During the 2010 mid-term elections, Jay-Z appeared with other artists in a HeadCount advertisement, urging voters, especially younger ones, to register and vote. In May 2012, Jay-Z endorsed President Obama support of same-sex marriage and participated in his re-election campaign. Musician and civil rights activist Harry Belafonte was critical of Jay-Z and Beyoncé for what he saw as their safe political stances, saying that they \"have turned their back on social responsibility\". In the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Jay-Z and Beyoncé appeared at a Hillary Clinton rally in Cleveland. Clinton praised Jay-Z for addressing racism, oppression, and the criminal justice system. He described Donald Trump as a \"superbug\" and condemned remarks he perceived as racist, but later said that Trump rhetoric forced people to come together and address difficult issues such as white privilege.

              " 'Lecrae Devaughn Moore (born October 9, 1979) is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, record executive, and actor. He is the president, co-owner and co-founder of the independent record label Reach Records, was the co-founder and president of the now-defunct non-profit organization ReachLife Ministries, is an investor and co-owner of the audio production software MXD, and is a co-founder of the film production studio 3 Strand Films. To date, he has released ten studio albums and three mixtapes as a solo artist, and has released three studio albums, a remix album, one EP, and numerous singles as the leader of the hip hop group 116 Clique. He produced much of his earlier material along with other early Reach Records releases. Lecrae, in reference to him being labeled as a Christian rapper, has stated that his music is just hip hop, though it reflects his Christian faith. In May 2016, Lecrae signed to Columbia Records in a joint deal between his label and Columbia. He left Columbia in May 2020. Lecrae debut recording, Real Talk, was released in 2004 through Reach Records. His third solo album, Rebel, released in 2008, became the first Christian hip-hop album to reach No. 1 on the Billboard Gospel chart. Rehab followed in 2010, and Lecrae began attracting mainstream attention when he performed at the 2011 BET Hip Hop Awards Cypher and appeared on the Statik Selektah song \"Live & Let Live\" from Population Control. On May 10, 2012, Lecrae released his first mixtape, Church Clothes, which was hosted by Don Cannon. Considered his breakthrough into mainstream hip hop, the mixtape was downloaded over 100,000 times in less than 48 hours. His sixth studio album, Gravity, came out on September 4, 2012, and has been called the most important album in Christian hip hop history by Rapzilla and Atlanta Daily World. The album debuted as the best-selling album overall in the iTunes Store, No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and won the Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards, marking the first time that a hip hop artist received this award. Lecrae released his seventh album, Anomaly, on September 9, 2014. It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with 88,587 copies sold through the first week, the first album to top both the Billboard 200 and the Gospel chart simultaneously. He released a third mixtape, Church Clothes 3, on January 15, 2016, an eighth studio album, All Things Work Together, on September 22, 2017, and a ninth studio album, Let the Trap Say Amen, a collaborative project with Zaytoven, on June 22, 2018. His tenth studio album, Restoration, was released on August 21, 2020. Lecrae received nominations for Artist of the Year at the 43rd, 44th, 45th, and 46th GMA Dove Awards, the last of which he won, and for Best Gospel Artist at the 2013 and 2015 BET Awards, the latter of which he won, a first for a rap artist. Lecrae filmography includes a role in the television film A Cross to Bear (2012) and brief roles in the comedy film Believe Me (2014), crime film Superfly (2018), and Christian drama film Breakthrough (2019). In the social sphere, Lecrae has presented on and written about racial tension and injustice in the United States as well as advocated for the preservation of responsibility and fatherhood values among men in the United States. In 2013 he partnered with Dwyane Wade and Joshua DuBois in the multimedia initiative This Is Fatherhood as part of the Obama administration Fatherhood and Mentoring Initiative, and in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic worked with Love Beyond Walls to distribute hand-washing stations and food to homeless people in Atlanta.  Life and career Early life Lecrae was raised by his single mother in a poor neighborhood in southern Houston. Shortly after his birth, he moved to Denver, away from his father, then to San Diego. At the age of 6, he was sexually abused by his babysitter. As a teenager, his role models were the rapper Tupac Shakur and his uncle, a member of a street gang. At age 16, he began using drugs, trying almost every substance except crack and heroin. He started stealing in high school and dealing drugs, using his grandmother Bible as a lucky charm. He was arrested for possession of drugs, but the policeman who arrested him discovered his Bible and made him promise that, if he let Lecrae go, he would live according to biblical principles from now on. Subsequently, he began rehab. He dropped drugs but replaced them with alcohol and partying. Lecrae received a scholarship to study theater at the University of North Texas, and graduated with a Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sciences in 2002. He also briefly attended Middle Tennessee State University. At 19, he went to a Bible study after being invited by a girl from college. He was amazed to see people like himself there, who liked the same books and music, but who were loving. He decided to live for God, but continued to make bad choices. Following a friend invitation, he attended a Christian conference in Atlanta and was impressed by the performance of a Christian rap group, The Cross Movement. He was also touched by a clear presentation of the gospel by Pastor James White (of Christ Our King Community Church). He then asked forgiveness for his sins and claimed to have experienced a new birth. Subsequently, he was in a car accident but came out unscathed. In 2003, in a Bible study meeting at Denton Bible Church in Denton, Texas, he met Ben Washer, with whom he would volunteer and sing in a juvenile correctional facility. Young people positive response to Christian rap encouraged them to start a label.  Early career (2004–2011) In 2004, five years after his conversion, Lecrae teamed up with Ben Washer to found Reach Records, and at the age of 25 he released his first album, Real Talk. The following year it was re-released by Cross Movement Records and reached No. 29 on the Billboard Gospel Albums chart, staying on the chart for 12 weeks. The album later received a nomination at the 2007 Stellar Awards. In 2005, Lecrae co-founded the non-profit organization ReachLife Ministries (no longer operational since April 2015), which equipped local Christian leaders with tools, media, curriculum, and conferences that were based on the teachings of the Bible and relevant to hip-hop culture. Also in 2005, the debut album of 116 Clique, The Compilation Album, was released. After the success of Real Talk, Lecrae then released his second studio album on August 15, 2006. After the Music Stops charted at No. 5 on the Billboard Gospel Albums chart, No. 7 on the Billboard Christian Albums chart and No. 16 on the Billboard Heatseeker Album charts, and received a nomination for a Dove Award, as did the single \"Jesus Muzik\", featuring Trip Lee. In 2007, 116 Clique released its second album, 13 Letters, reaching No. 10 on the Gospel Albums chart and No. 29 on the Christian Albums chart. 116 Clique also released the remix EP Amped, which peaked at No. 24 on the Gospel Albums chart. On October 8, 2008, Lecrae third album, Rebel, entered the Billboard charts at No. 60 with 9,800 units sold and topped the Billboard Gospel Album charts for two weeks, the first hip-hop album to do so. It also charted at No. 2 on the Christian Albums chart and No. 15 on the Top Independent charts. In 2009, the album received a nomination at the 40th Dove Awards, as did the Flame song \"Joyful Noise\", which featured Lecrae and John Reilly. 2009 also saw Lecrae first film role, when he appeared in the documentary Uprise Presents: Word from the Street by the UK-based TV channel OHTV. In 2009, he moved to Atlanta and he helped establish Blueprint Church (Southern Baptist Convention). On February 5, 2010, Lecrae released a charity single entitled \"Far Away\", a tribute to the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Lecrae promised that all proceeds from the single sales would go directly to the Haiti relief effort. On July 7, Lecrae announced on the Reach Records website that the title of his new album would be Rehab. On August 5, 2010, Rapzilla shared a new song from Lecrae called \"Amp It Up\". Lecrae subsequently clarified on his Twitter account that the song was not a single from Rehab, but rather a theme song for Kanakuk Kamps, a chain of Christian camps for which he writes songs annually. On August 31, 2010, Reach Records revealed the track list for Rehab, released it for pre-order, and premiered a promotional video \"Idols\". A second promotional video, entitled \"I Am Dust\", debuted on September 9, 2010. Upon its release, Rehab hit No. 16 on the Billboard 200 chart, making it one of the highest selling Christian hip hop albums at that time. On September 22, 2010, Rapzilla reported that the Rehab packaging came with an advertisement encouraging buyers to purchase another upcoming album, Rehab: The Overdose, which saw release on January 11, 2011. It included 11 new songs and featured several other Christian artists such as Thil and Swoope. Rehab: The Overdose debuted at No. 15 on the Billboard 200. On August 29, 2011, Lecrae announced through Twitter that on September 27, 2011, he would release a special edition of Rehab, entitled Rehab: Deluxe Edition. On the same day, 116 Clique released their fourth album, entitled Man Up. On September 7, 2011, Rapzilla announced that Lecrae would be featured on the BET Hip Hop Awards Cypher on October 11, 2011. Lecrae gained popularity after his verse on the cypher trended nationwide on Twitter and was featured on AllHipHop. Lecrae then appeared as a feature on Statik Selektah song \"Live and Let Live\" from his Population Control album.  Mainstream breakthrough (2012–2016) On February 16, 2012, Rapzilla announced that Lecrae was preparing to release his first mixtape, Church Clothes. On May 3, 2012, Lecrae premiered his music video for the title track of his Church Clothes mixtape online on XXL. The video was noted for including cameos by Kendrick Lamar and DJ Premier, and attracted almost 20,000 views in less than a day. Hosted by Don Cannon, the mixtape featured the song Darkest Hour, in which Lecrae collaborated with No Malice of Clipse. Church Clothes was downloaded more than 100,000 times in less than 48 hours on DatPiff.com, and in less than a month reached 250,000 downloads, a platinum rating on the website. On June 25, 2012, a remastered version of the mixtape, without DJ Don Cannon, was released as an EP for sale on iTunes. Due to issues with sampling, this version was much shorter with only seven songs. Upon its release, the EP debuted on the Billboard charts at No. 10 on both the Christian Albums and Gospel Albums charts for the week of July 14, 2012. On April 27, Lecrae announced that his next album, Gravity, was to be released in late 2012, and recording sessions began in May.

It is the first time an album tops both the Billboard 200 and the Gospel Albums chart. Lecrae also became the fifth artist following Chris Tomlin (2013), TobyMac (2012), LeAnn Rimes (1997) and Bob Carlisle (1997) to score a number one album on both Christian Albums and the Billboard 200. Anomaly also marks the sixth time that Lecrae topped the Gospel Albums chart and the fifth time he topped the Christian Albums chart.

The song was subsequently released on October 21, 2014, in the iTunes store. The single \"All I Need Is You\" from the album was nominated for Best Rap Performance at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, and on June 12, 2019, the song was certified Gold by the RIAA. To promote Anomaly, on September 18, 2014, Lecrae appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, performing alongside The Roots, the program house band. He made a subsequent appearance the following year, on January 9, 2015, this time as a featured performer. On January 15, 2016, Lecrae released his third mixtape Church Clothes 3. The mixtape debuted at No. 12 on the Billboard 200 and No. 1 on the Christian, Rap, and Independent charts, selling some 29,207 units.  Signing with Columbia and Restoration (2016–present) In August 2015, Lecrae announced an upcoming memoir titled Unashamed, which on May 3, 2016, was published through B&H Publishing Group, a subsidiary of LifeWay Christian Resources. It opened at No. 19 on The New York Times Best Seller list. In May 2016, Lecrae signed to Columbia Records, which will release future recordings in conjunction with Reach. Lecrae explained that he signed this deal in order to increase the international audience for Reach, since his label peaked nationally with the release of Anomaly. In September 2016, Reach Records announced Lecrae upcoming tour schedule, The Destination Tour (Youre Accepted), which ran through October and November. On October 21, 2016, Lecrae released the single \"Cant Stop Me Now (Destination)\", the lead single from his upcoming studio album. On January 27, 2017, he released the second single \"Blessings\", featuring Ty Dolla Sign. Lecrae followed this up with the third single \"Ill Find You\", featuring Tori Kelly, on June 8, 2017. Then, on June 23, 2017, he released a promotional single \"Hammer Time\", featuring 1K Phew. On August 7, 2017, Lecrae announced his eighth studio album, All Things Work Together, his major label debut. The album was released on September 22, 2017. \"Blessings\" went on to be certified Gold on April 30, 2019, and \"Ill Find You\" was certified Platinum on February 26, 2020. On May 24, 2018, he announced in a DJ Booth editorial that he and producer Zaytoven would release a collaborative album called Let the Trap Say Amen. The album was released on June 22, 2018. In December 2019, the Atlanta Hawks accidentally leaked information about a new Lecrae album coming March 2020 when they posted about a Lecrae performance—also in March—that included information about the album: Restoration. In an interview with Black Enterprise, Lecrae said that he is excited to put out some healing music, that there is always \"hope, healing, and restoration available if you seek it\". In the same interview, Lecrae discussed his forthcoming second book, I Am Restored: How I Lost My Religion but Found My Faith, which will be a follow-up to his first book Unashamed. I Am Restored will release October 13, 2020. The first single to Restoration, \"Set Me Free\", featuring YK Osiris, and the accompanying music video, was released on March 20, 2020. In May 2020, Lecrae left Columbia, and stated that this would give him more artistic freedom and control. Restoration was released on August 21, 2020. On December 3, 2021, Lecrae released No Church In a While, a ten-track collaboration album with 1K Phew. With American Christian rapper Andy Mineo, he released \"Coming In Hot\", as a single, and later included on the Reach Records collaborative album titled Summer Eighteen. It has been certified RIAA Digital Gold for more than 500,000 downloads and on-demand streams in August 2021, and Digital Platinum in 2023 for exceeding one million, also becoming a viral song on social networks, even used by personalities like Kim Kardashian and Will Smith. It managed to position itself on Billboard three years after its release, making this a rare phenomenon in music.  Influences and musical style Lecrae musical genre is predominantly Southern hip hop and has been described as falling under the styles of crunk, gangsta rap, and hardcore hip hop. On his third release, Rebel, Lecrae slowed down his style on many songs. Rehab was noted for its stylistic diversity, particularly on the song \"Children of the Light\", which featured Dillavou and Sonny Sandoval and incorporated rock, and reggae influences. With the release Gravity, Billboard described Lecrae as incorporating reggae and soul influences into his \"signature brash sound.\" Let the Trap Say Amen blended Lecrae spiritual lyrics with Zaytoven trap-style production. Regarding which musical artists have influenced him, Lecrae, in an interview with Essence, cited Tupac, Nas, DJ Quik, Scarface, and The Cross Movement. In an interview with The Christian Post, Lecrae listed his top favorite five hip hop artists as Tupac, Nas, The Ambassador, Snoop Dogg, and Jay Z, though he admires Jay-Z for his business approach rather than his music. Lecrae also names Outkast and Lauryn Hill as major influences, particularly their albums Aquemini and The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, respectively. He considers Hill song \"Adam Lives in Theory\" the top song that nourishes him spiritually. In the song \"Non-Fiction\", he lists the Tunnel Rats alongside The Cross Movement as an influence when he was newly converted to Christianity. Theologically, Lecrae follows the Reformed tradition and is considered an influential figure in the New Calvinist movement. He cites Tommy Nelson, John MacArthur, and John Piper, among others, as early influences on his Christian faith, and Lecrae even titled one of his songs, \"Dont Waste Your Life\", after the book of the same name by Piper. Lecrae explains that through Nelson, MacArthur, and Piper, he subsequently discovered Charles Spurgeon, John Calvin, and Francis Schaeffer, the last of whom Lecrae calls his \"personal hero\". Other theologians cited by Lecrae include Tim Keller, Andy Crouch, Randy Alcorn, and Abraham Kuyper. He also looks to Martin Luther King Jr. for inspiration on working out faith in application to social issues. According to Miami New Times, he frequently tells the press: \"My music is not Christian, Lecrae is.\"  He continues: \"I think Christian is a wonderful noun, but a terrible adjective. Are there Christian shoes, Christian clothes, Christian plumbers, Christian pipes? I think if youre going to, you should label it hip-hop... hip-hop is a particular poetic style. Labeling it with the faith assumes that the song is going to be some kind of sermon, but there a lot of social and political things that I dont think make it gospel or Christian music.\" He also stated, \"I like to wrap my mind around a total situation. Im a social anthropologist. If I never been homeless, let me try to be homeless for a week and soak up that information. More like a method actor. So for me it spending time with people and talking about things from their perspective.\"  Popular culture Brooklyn Nets guard Jeremy Lin recommended Lecrae and Hillsong in an interview when asked about his pre-game music. Former NFL quarterback Tim Tebow and professional wrestler Ezekiel Jackson have also endorsed Lecrae. During March 2014, Lecrae signed a ten-day contract with the Atlanta Hawks, and on April 4, 2014, he performed live at Philips Arena after the Hawks game. \"Dum Dum\", a song by Tedashii featuring Lecrae, was used on an episode of So You Think You Can Dance. Lecrae also created the theme song for a new ESPN SportsCenter block called \"Coast to Coast\".  Social activism In 2011, 116 Clique and ReachLife Ministries, both headed by Lecrae, launched a media campaign titled Man Up, intended to mentor male urban youths on fatherhood and biblical manhood. It features concert tours and a curriculum centered on a short film and a studio album, both titled Man Up, and since 2012 has also featured a string of conference events. In May 2013, Lecrae partnered with NBA player Dwyane Wade, filmmaker Art Hooker, and Joshua DuBois, the former head of the Office of Faith Based and Neighborhood Partnerships under the Obama administration, to create the national media campaign This Is Fatherhood, an initiative \"devoted to restoring America commitment to healthy fatherhood.\" The campaign began on May 1 with a \"This is Fatherhood Challenge\", in which contestants could submit videos, songs, and essays about fatherhood through June 10. The winners received cash prizes and a trip to Washington, D.C., for a ceremony on Father Day. In addition, Lecrae offered studio time and mentoring to the grand prize winner. Lecrae, Wade, DuBois, Jay Z, and U.S. President Barack Obama all made appearances in the campaign promotional public service announcements. Lecrae has also contributed op-ed articles to Billboard dealing with race relations in the United States, including the 2014 Ferguson unrest, 2015 Charleston church shooting, and 2016 shootings of Alton Stirling, Philando Castile, and five Dallas police officers. In these articles, Lecrae has called for understanding and empathy across racial divides and willingness to listen to the oppressed, and also pointed out the need for spiritual healing through Jesus Christ. In mid 2016, Lecrae did a talk about racial reconciliation at Yale University, titled \"Knowledge through Narrative: Bridging the Racial Divide in America\". He also spoke on hip hop culture at a Nashville TEDx conference, decrying the misogyny and violence rampant in much of hip hop lyrics but advocating for hip hop to be used as an agent for social change. At the 2016 BET Hip Hop Awards, Lecrae performed an original composition addressing racial injustice in the United States, referencing the shooting of Philando Castile. In March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Lecrae worked with a local non-profit, Love Beyond Walls, to distribute hand-washing stations and food to homeless people in Atlanta. He also wrote an essay for Billboard in which he discussed the need for humane behavior in the midst of widespread social panic due to the outbreak. After the murder of George Floyd, Lecrae was inspired to write \"Deep End\", which was a late addition to Restoration. Lecrae also serves on the board of Peace Preparatory Academy in Atlanta, a nonprofit school dedicated to the care of those in their school and in their community.  Other business ventures Lecrae has partnered with Oust Labs to be an investor and co-owner of the audio production software MXD, which was founded by Jacob \"Biz\" Morris. In 2020, Lecrae teamed up with Adam Thomason to found the film production studio 3 Strand Films. He is a venture partner in Collab Capital, and has participated in several real estate ventures, including Invest Atlanta and Peace Preparatory Academy, intended to revitalize English Avenue.  Personal life Lecrae currently resides in Atlanta since relocating there from Memphis in 2009, and is married to Darragh Moore. The couple have three children together. In an interview with HipHopDX, Lecrae stated that Clipse member No Malice sought him out as a spiritual advisor. On October 20, 2016, Lecrae wrote in The Huffington Post that he has been struggling with depression and doubt, which was partly caused by the backlash he received from many American evangelicals who are critical of his public stance on race-related issues. On August 14, 2020, Lecrae posted a video on his YouTube channel that includes footage of him re-connecting with his long-absent father who now resides in San Diego.

              " 'Joscelyn Eve Stoker (born 11 April 1987), known professionally as Joss Stone, is an English singer, songwriter and actress. She rose to prominence in late 2003 with her multi-platinum debut album, The Soul Sessions, which made the 2004 Mercury Prize shortlist. Her second album, Mind Body & Soul (2004), topped the UK Albums Chart and spawned the top-ten single \"You Had Me\", Stone most successful single on the UK Singles Chart to date. Both the album and single received one nomination at the 2005 Grammy Awards, while Stone herself was nominated for Best New Artist, and in an annual BBC poll of music critics, Sound of 2004, was ranked fifth as a predicted breakthrough act of 2004. She became the youngest British female singer to top the UK Albums Chart. Stone third album, Introducing Joss Stone, released in March 2007, achieved gold record status by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and yielded the second-ever highest debut for a British female solo artist on the Billboard 200, and became Stone first top-five album in the US. She released her fourth album, Colour Me Free!, in 2009, which reached the top 10 on Billboard 200. Stone released her fifth album, LP1, in 2011, which reached the top 10 on Billboard. Throughout her career, Stone has sold 15 million records worldwide, establishing herself as one of the best-selling soul artists of the 2000s, and the best-selling British artists of her time. Her first three albums have sold over 2,722,000 copies in the US, while her first two albums have sold over 2 million copies in the UK. Stone has earned several awards including two Brit Awards and one Grammy Award out of five nominations. She made her film acting debut in 2006 with the fantasy adventure film Eragon, and made her television debut portraying Anne of Cleves in the Showtime series The Tudors in 2009. Stone was the youngest woman on the 2006 Sunday Times Rich List—an annual list of the UK wealthiest people—with £6 million. In 2012, her net worth was estimated to be £10 million, making her the fifth richest British musician under 30. The Soul Sessions Vol. 2 (2012) is her fourth consecutive album to reach the top 10 on the Billboard 200.  Early life Joscelyn Eve Stoker was born on 11 April 1987 at Buckland Hospital in Dover, Kent, and spent her teenage years in Ashill, a small village near Cullompton in Devon. She is the third of four children born to Wendy (née Skillin) and Richard Stoker. Her father owns a fruit and nut import–export business; her mother worked as Stone manager until October 2004. Stone made her first public appearance at the Uffculme Comprehensive School, which she attended, in Uffculme, Devon, with a cover version of Jackie Wilson 1957 song \"Reet Petite\". Stone has dyslexia and left school at age sixteen with three GCSE qualifications. \"It wasnt that I was stupid. Im just a little bit dyslexic and I wasnt very academic. Im more artistic\", she says. Stone grew up listening to a wide variety of music including 1960s and 1970s American R&B and soul music performed by such artists as Dusty Springfield and Aretha Franklin. As a result, she developed a soulful style of singing like her idols. \"My first CD that I owned was Aretha Franklin: Greatest Hits. And I saw the advert on TV and it was just like little clips of her songs. I had no idea who she was—I was only like 10 so. I said, Oh yeah, that looks really good, so I wrote it down and I said to my mum, Can I have that for Christmas? So she told my friend Dennis, who always gets me good music anyway, and he got that for me. So that was one of my first albums that I loved.\" She would later tell MTV News: \"I kind of clicked into soul music more than anything else because of the vocals. Youve got to have good vocals to sing soul music and I always liked it ever since I was little.\"  Career 2001–2003: Beginnings and The Soul Sessions In 2001, aged 13, Stone auditioned for the BBC Television talent show Star for a Night in London, singing Aretha Franklin 1968 Goffin-King hit \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\" and Whitney Houston 1999 single, \"It Not Right but It Okay\". After passing her audition, she sang Donna Summer  \"On the Radio\" for the broadcast, and eventually won the contest. She also appeared on and won Steps to the Stars (a TV programme hosted by H & Claire of the group Steps). Stone then performed on a charity show, where she drew the attention of the Boilerhouse Boys, composed of London-based producers Andy Dean and Ben Wolfe, who contacted S-Curve Records founder and CEO, Steve Greenberg in December 2001 telling him \"they had just heard the greatest singer theyd ever heard from their country\". In early 2002, Greenberg flew Stone to New York for an audition, in which she sang to backing tracks of classic soul songs: Otis Redding 1968 \"(Sittin On) The Dock of the Bay\", Gladys Knight & the Pips 1973 \"Midnight Train to Georgia\", and Franklin \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\"; Greenberg instantly signed her to his label. After being signed by S-Curve Records, her US market album was released by S-Curve Records and in the international market her album was released by EMI Music. Stone flew to Miami and Philadelphia to start work on her debut album, The Soul Sessions, released on 16 September 2003. She collaborated with people with solid credentials in the Miami soul scene such as Betty Wright, Benny Latimore, Timmy Thomas and Little Beaver as well as contemporary acts Angie Stone and the Roots. The album, produced by Steve Greenberg, Mike Mangini and Betty Wright, consists of little-known soul tracks by Franklin, Laura Lee, Bettye Swann and others. Released in late 2003, it reached the top five on the UK Albums Chart as well as the top forty of the US Billboard 200 chart. The lead single, \"Fell in Love with a Boy\", a reworking of the White Stripes 2001 \"Fell in Love with a Girl\", reached the top 20 of the UK Singles Chart, as did the second single, a cover version of Sugar Billy 1974 song \"Super Duper Love (Are You Diggin on Me)\". The album eventually went triple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry in mid-April 2005 and gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in late March 2004.  2004–2006: Mind Body & Soul and film debut After achieving critical acclaim with The Soul Sessions, Stone worked on new material, and recorded her second album, Mind Body & Soul, which was released on 28 September 2004, produced by the same team as her first album. She called the album her real debut. It debuted at No. one in the UK, breaking the record for the youngest female ever to top the UK Albums Chart, and just missed the top ten of the US Billboard 200 after peaking at No. 11. The lead single, \"You Had Me\", became her biggest hit to date when it rose to No. 9 in the UK. Follow-up singles \"Right to Be Wrong\" and \"Spoiled\" both made the top 40, and \"Dont Cha Wanna Ride\", the top 20. \"Spoiled\" landed just outside the top 50 of US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, peaking at No. 54. In early September 2005, Mind, Body & Soul was certified triple platinum by the BPI and platinum by the RIAA. In April 2004, Stone performed during the VH1 benefit concert Divas Live 2004 alongside Ashanti, Cyndi Lauper, Gladys Knight, Jessica Simpson and Patti LaBelle, in support of the Save the Music Foundation. Stone joined Band Aid 20 on 14 November 2004 in benefit of Sudan troubled Darfur region. The group, which included Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin and U2 lead singer Bono, re-recorded the 1984 song \"Do They Know It Christmas?\", written by Band Aid organisers Bob Geldof and Midge Ure. Stone, who was born two years after the release of the original single, was not initially aware of who Bob Geldof was, with media reporting that she repeatedly referred to him as Bob Gandalf. Despite some criticism, the single became the UK biggest-selling single of 2004 as well as the 2004 Christmas number-one single. At the 2005 BRIT Awards, Stone won for British Female Solo Artist and British Urban Act—entering the Guinness World Records as the youngest BRIT Award solo winner at age seventeen, and was nominated for British Breakthrough Act. She also received a nomination for Best UK Act of the Year at the 2005 MOBO Awards, as well as three nominations for the 2005 Grammy Awards—Best New Artist, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"You Had Me\", and Best Pop Vocal Album for Mind Body & Soul, where she sang with rock performer Melissa Etheridge, in tribute to blues-rock singer Janis Joplin. Their performance of \"Cry Baby/Piece of My Heart\" was released as a single, and through the aid of strong digital download sales, became Stone first single to enter the US Billboard Hot 100, when it debuted and peaked at No. 32 the week of 2 April 2005.  In March 2005, Stone was named the spokesperson for the Gap clothing company, replacing the actress Sarah Jessica Parker. She appeared in a television advertisement for that store chain singing a cover of Ray Charles 1958 song \"Night Time Is the Right Time\" (retitled \"The Right Time\"). Stone also appeared in one of Gap Fall 2005 \"Favorites\" commercials, singing the Beach Boys 1966 song \"God Only Knows\". By that time, rumours circulated about her being dropped from the campaign because she was living with then-25-year-old songwriter and producer Beau Dozier (son of Motown producer and composer Lamont Dozier) in Los Angeles while she was only 17. However, Gap later denied the rumours, stating that they were very happy with Stone and telling BBC Radio 1 that the claims were \"absolute tosh\" and \"a complete fabrication\". On 11 April 2005, Stone performed \"Spoiled\", Rufus 1974 song \"Tell Me Something Good\" with John Legend, Otis Redding 1966 song \"Try a Little Tenderness\" with Donna Summer, and 1977 \"Hot Legs\" with Rod Stewart at \"Save the Music: A Concert to Benefit the VH1 Save the Music Foundation\", in benefit of VH1 Save the Music Foundation. Three months later, on 2 July 2005, Stone performed \"Super Duper Love\", \"I Had a Dream\", and \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" at the Live 8 concert at Hyde Park, London. Stone was an opening act for the Rolling Stones during their 2005 A Bigger Bang tour. Stone performed a medley of \"It a Man World\" and \"Papa Got a Brand New Bag\" with James Brown on BBC One chat show Friday Night with Jonathan Ross on 1 July 2005. Stone collaborated with jazz pianist Herbie Hancock and blues singer-guitarist Jonny Lang on a cover of U2 1988 song \"When Love Comes to Town\" for Hancock 2005 album Possibilities. That same year, Stone was featured along with Sean Paul on Santana \"Cry Baby Cry\", and worked on a remake of Patti LaBelle 1985 song \"Stir It Up\" for the soundtrack to the Disney animated film Chicken Little. She also collaborated with Lemar in 2006 on his third studio album, The Truth About Love, on the track \"Anniversary\". On 5 February 2006, Stone joined Stevie Wonder, India.Arie, and John Legend during the Super Bowl XL pre-game ceremonies to perform a medley of Wonder hits. Three days later, on 8 February, on the night of the 2006 Grammy Awards, she helped perform a medley of Sly & the Family Stone hits alongside Legend, Ciara, Maroon 5, will.i.am, Robert Randolph, Steven Tyler and Joe Perry. Stone made her film debut in the fantasy adventure film Eragon (based on the 2003 novel of the same name by Christopher Paolini), directed by Stefen Fangmeier and released on 15 December 2006, playing the fortune teller Angela. At the 2007 Grammy Awards, Stone shared the award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for her collaboration with John Legend and Van Hunt on their 2005 cover of Sly & the Family Stone 1971 chart-topper \"Family Affair\".  2007–2008: Introducing Joss Stone Stone caused controversy at the 2007 BRIT Awards ceremony on 14 February 2007 while presenting the award for British Male Solo Artist (won by James Morrison). Speaking in an American accent, she circled the podium and gave a speech about Robbie Williams, who had been the target of earlier jokes made by host Russell Brand. Williams had been reported as going into rehabilitation that same week. As her speech continued, she made remarks about Brand, implying that he was heading for rehabilitation himself (while singing a passage of Amy Winehouse hit \"Rehab\"). In response to the British media reaction, Stone responded, \"At the end of the day, I dont give a fuck if people have a problem with my accent. That all I can say about it. The words I say do not change. If the way that it sounds is skew-wiff and you dont like it, dont listen. Im not being a cruel person by sounding a different way. And I cant help it. Ive been [in America working] since I was, like, 14.\" Stone later claimed that her record label cancelled all her upcoming press appearances to publicise her upcoming third album as a result of the backlash.  Stone began work on her third studio album, Introducing Joss Stone, at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas, in May 2006. Released on 12 March 2007, the album was coordinated by A&R Chris Anokute, produced by Raphael Saadiq, and included collaborations with Lauryn Hill, Common, and Joi. Virgin Records describes the album as \"an electrifying mix of warm vintage soul, 1970s-style R&B, Motown girl-group harmonies, and hip-hop grooves\". Stone herself describes it as \"truly me. That why Im calling it Introducing Joss Stone. These are my words, and this is who I am as an artist.\" She also revealed on The Tavis Smiley Show that her break-up with Beau Dozier was a source of inspiration while writing Introducing Joss Stone. The album debuted and peaked at No. 12 on the UK Albums Chart, not managing to match the success of Stone two previous albums. It nevertheless debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 selling 118,000 copies in its first week, becoming the highest debut for a British solo female artist on the US chart, surpassing the record previously held by Amy Winehouse with Back to Black (which in turn would later be outdone by Leona Lewis, whose album Spirit debuted at No. 1 the week of 26 April 2008). \"Tell Me Bout It\", the album lead single, debuted and peaked at No. 28 on the UK Singles Chart. The second single, \"Tell Me What Were Gonna Do Now\", a collaboration with rapper Common, failed to chart inside the UK top seventy-five. Stone and Common turned the single music video into a Product Red, reverting 100% of the gains from copies of the video purchased from iTunes to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Stone is the first Product Red artist to do so. Stone also sampled Franklin \"Respect\", taking the texture and sound of the song, but keeping her own composition. \"Baby Baby Baby\" was released digitally in December 2007 and physically in January 2008 as the third single. In support of the album, Stone embarked on a North American tour which began on 27 April at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard, Connecticut and ended on 13 June at the Filene Center in Vienna, Virginia, visiting sixteen cities in total including Philadelphia, San Francisco, Vancouver, Chicago, Toronto, New York and Boston.

              " 'Robyn Rihanna Fenty (  ree-AN-ə; born February 20, 1988) is a Barbadian singer, businesswoman and actress based in the United States. She was  cited as the best-selling female recording artist of the 21st century by Guinness World Records and is one of the best-selling recording artists of all time, with sales estimated at 250 million units worldwide. Rihanna is the highest-certified female digital single artist and the only female artist to have seven U.S. diamond certified singles. She has achieved 14 number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. The recipient of numerous awards and nominations, Rihanna remains the wealthiest female musical artist with an estimated net worth of $1.4 billion as of 2024. Rihanna signed with Def Jam Recordings in 2005 and found mainstream recognition following the release of her first two studio albums, Music of the Sun (2005) and A Girl Like Me (2006). Both influenced by Caribbean music, the albums peaked within the top ten on the US Billboard 200 chart. Her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), incorporated elements of dance-pop, and established her status as a pop icon. Its lead single \"Umbrella\" peaked atop the US Billboard Hot 100 and won her first Grammy Award. Rihanna continued to blend pop, dance, and R&B influences on her next albums, Rated R (2009), Loud (2010), Talk That Talk (2011), and Unapologetic (2012)—the latter of which peaked the Billboard 200. The albums spawned the Billboard Hot 100-number one singles \"Rude Boy\", \"Only Girl (In the World)\", \"What My Name?\", \"S&M\", \"We Found Love\", and \"Diamonds\". Her eighth album, Anti (2016), showcased new creative control following her departure from Def Jam in favor of Jay-Z label, Roc Nation. Becoming her second US number one album, it was supported by the chart-topping single \"Work\". Throughout her career, Rihanna has worked with artists including Coldplay, Drake, Eminem, Kanye West, Ne-Yo, and Shakira. Aside from music, Rihanna is recognized for her humanitarian involvement,  entrepreneurship, and fashion industry influence. She established the Clara Lionel Foundation, cosmetics brand Fenty Beauty, and fashion house Fenty under LVMH, becoming the first black woman to lead a luxury brand for LVMH. Rihanna has acted in major roles in Battleship (2012), Home (2015), Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017), and Ocean 8 (2018). In 2018, she was appointed as an ambassador by the Government of Barbados and declared a National Hero of Barbados in 2021.  Early life Robyn Rihanna Fenty was born on February 20, 1988, in Saint Michael, Barbados. She is the daughter of accountant Monica (née Braithwaite) and warehouse supervisor Ronald Fenty. Her mother is Afro-Guyanese, while her father is a Barbadian of African, Irish, English, and Scottish descent. Rihanna has two brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty, and two half-sisters and a half-brother from her father side, each born to different mothers from his previous relationships. She grew up in a three-bedroom bungalow in Bridgetown and sold clothes with her father in a stall on the street. Her childhood was deeply affected by her father alcoholism and crack-cocaine addiction, which contributed to her parents strained marriage. Rihanna father used to abuse her mother physically, and Rihanna would try to get in between them to break up fights. As a child, Rihanna had many CT scans for the excruciating headaches that she suffered, recalling, \"The doctors even thought it was a tumor, because it was that intense.\" By the time she was 14, her parents had divorced, and her health began to improve. She grew up listening to reggae music. She attended Charles F. Broome Memorial Primary School and Combermere School, where she studied alongside future international cricketers Chris Jordan and Carlos Brathwaite. At age 11, Rihanna was a cadet in Barbados Cadet Corps; the later Barbadian singer-songwriter Shontelle was her drill sergeant. She initially wanted to graduate from high school, but she chose to pursue a musical career instead.  Music career 2003–2006: Beginnings and early releases In 2003, Rihanna formed a musical trio with two of her classmates in her home country of Barbados. Without a name or any material, the girl group auditioned with American record producer Evan Rogers, who commented, \"The minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didnt exist.\" Rihanna later performed renditions of Destiny Child \"Emotion\" and Mariah Carey \"Hero\". Impressed, Rogers scheduled a second meeting with Rihanna mother present and then invited Rihanna to his hometown in the United States to record some demo tapes that could be sent to record labels. Recordings were intermittent, taking about a year because she was only able to record during school holidays. \"Pon de Replay\" and \"The Last Time\" were two tracks recorded for the demo tape, which were eventually included on her debut album Music of the Sun. That same year, Rihanna was signed to Rogers and Carl Sturken production company, Syndicated Rhythm Productions. Rihanna demo was shipped out to Def Jam Recordings, where Jay Brown, an A&R executive at the record label, was one of the first to hear the demo. Brown played the demo tape for rapper Jay-Z, who had recently been appointed as president and CEO of Def Jam. When Jay-Z first heard the track \"Pon de Replay\", he felt the song was too big for her. Despite being skeptical, he invited Rihanna to audition for the label. In early 2005, Rihanna auditioned for Def Jam in New York City, where Jay-Z introduced her to music mogul Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid. At the audition, she sang Whitney Houston cover of \"For the Love of You\", as well as the demo tracks \"Pon de Replay\" and \"The Last Time\". Jay-Z was absolutely certain about signing her after she performed her future single \"Pon de Replay\". His boss, L.A. Reid, was also impressed with her audition, telling Jay-Z not to let Rihanna leave the building until the contract was signed. Reid left it to Jay-Z and his team to close the deal which resulted in a six-album record deal with Def Jam. She waited in Jay-Z office until 3:00 in the morning to get lawyers to draft up a contract because he wanted to prevent her from signing with another label. Rihanna canceled other meetings with record labels and relocated from Barbados to the United States to live with Rogers and his wife.  After signing with Def Jam, Jay-Z and his team did the A&R for Rihanna debut album and spent the next three months recording and completing her debut album. She worked with different producers to complete her debut studio album, primarily Rogers and his production partner Carl Sturken. With several songs to pick as a lead single, \"Pon de Replay\" was chosen because it seemed like the best song suited for a summer release. In May 2005, her debut single, \"Pon de Replay\", was released under her mononym \"Rihanna\". It charted successfully worldwide, peaking in the top five in fifteen countries, including at No. 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart. The song became a club hit in the United States, peaking at No. 1 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs. Music of the Sun was released in August 2005. It debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard 200 and received a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of over 500,000 units. The album sold over 2 million copies worldwide. A second single, \"If It Lovin that You Want\", was not as successful as its predecessor, but reached the top 10 in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand. Aside from her work in music, Rihanna made her acting debut in a cameo role in the successful straight-to-DVD film Bring It On: All or Nothing, released in August 2006. A month after the release of her debut album, Rihanna began working on her second studio album. A Girl like Me was released in April 2006. Rolling Stone felt that \"the burning rock guitar\" and haunted strings of some of the album tracks made \"A Girl like Me [...] likable.\" The album was a commercial success, charting in the top 10 in 13 countries. The album reached No. 1 in Canada and No. 5 in the United Kingdom and the United States, where it sold 115,000 copies in its first week. The album became Rihanna first to be certified Platinum by the RIAA, after selling over 1,000,000 units. Its lead single, \"SOS\", was an international success, charting in the top five in 11 countries. The song reached No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and in Australia, her first to reach this chart position. \"Unfaithful\", the album second single, reached the top 10 in 18 countries, including No. 1 in Canada and Switzerland. Two more singles were released from the album: \"We Ride\" and \"Break It Off\".  2007–2008: Breakthrough with Good Girl Gone Bad In early 2007, Rihanna appeared on the single \"Roll It\" with Jamaican band J-Status and fellow Barbadian singer-songwriter Shontelle. The song appeared on J-Status debut album The Beginning, released in several European countries only. Around that time, Rihanna had already begun work on her third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad. With the help of producers Timbaland, Tricky Stewart and Sean Garrett she embraced a new musical direction through uptempo dance tracks. Released in May 2007, the album charted at No. 2 in Australia and the US and topped the charts in multiple countries, including Brazil, Canada, Ireland and the UK. The album received the most positive critical reviews of her first three albums.  The lead single, \"Umbrella\", topped the charts in 13 countries and remained at No. 1 in the UK for 10 consecutive weeks, the longest-running No. 1 single there since Wet Wet Wet single \"Love Is All Around\" spent 15 weeks at the top in 1994. It was Rihanna first single to be named one of the best-selling singles worldwide, with sales of over 8 million copies. The songs \"Shut Up and Drive\", \"Hate That I Love You\" (featuring Ne-Yo), and \"Dont Stop the Music\" were also released as singles, with the latter becoming an international hit. In support of the album, Rihanna began the Good Girl Gone Bad Tour in September 2007, with 80 shows across the US, Canada, and Europe. Rihanna was nominated for several 2008 Grammy Awards for Good Girl Gone Bad, winning Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Umbrella\" alongside Jay-Z, her first Grammy Award. On June 9, 2008, Rihanna released Good Girl Gone Bad Live, her first live long-form video. The DVD and Blu-ray release featured Rihanna concert at the Manchester Arena in Manchester, United Kingdom, held on December 6, 2007, as part of the Good Girl Gone Bad Tour. The release also contained a special documentary that presented Rihanna discussing her experiences during the tour. By late 2008, Rihanna still remained on the charts with the release of the fifth single from Good Girl Gone Bad, \"Rehab\", and was named \"Diva of the Year\" by Entertainment Weekly for her \"newfound staying power\". Good Girl Gone Bad has sold over 2.8 million units in the United States alone, receiving a two-times-Platinum certification from the RIAA. It is Rihanna bestselling album in the country to date. The album has sold 9 million units worldwide. During the late 2000s, Rihanna experimented further with pop, dubstep, and rock music, officially shifting her musical style and image away from the Barbados island girl. Throughout 2008, Rihanna performed on the Glow in the Dark Tour alongside Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, and N.E.R.D. Her third studio album reissue, Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded, was released in June 2008 with three new songs: \"Disturbia\", \"Take a Bow\" and the Maroon 5 duet \"If I Never See Your Face Again\", plus a Spanglish version of \"Hate That I Love You\" featuring Spanish pop singer David Bisbal. All four were released as singles and charted highly, reaching peak positions worldwide. In August 2008, Rihanna and a host of other female singers recorded the charity single \"Just Stand Up!\", the theme song to the anti-cancer campaign Stand Up to Cancer. \"Live Your Life\", a duet between T.I. and Rihanna, was released that November and topped the Billboard Hot 100.  2009–2011: Rated R and Loud On February 8, 2009, Rihanna scheduled performance at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards was canceled. Reports surfaced that then-boyfriend, singer Chris Brown, had physically assaulted her. He was arrested on suspicion of making criminal threats. On March 5, 2009, Brown was charged with assault and making criminal threats. A leaked photograph from the police department obtained by TMZ.com revealed that Rihanna had sustained visible injuries.

That if it not better than that then it is not even worth it\", noting that \"it not the right way to look at music\" and \"if I keep waiting until this feels right and perfect and better, maybe it going to keep taking forever and maybe itll never come out and no, Im not down to that.\" During this period, Rihanna appeared on Canadian singer PartyNextDoor song \"Believe It\", which was released on March 27, 2020.

Artistry Music and voice Rihanna is a mezzo-soprano, with a range spanning from B2 to C♯6. While recording tracks for her third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), Rihanna took vocal lessons from Ne-Yo. She said of the experience, \"Ive never had vocal training, so when Im in the studio, hell tell me how to breathe and stuff... Hell call out these big fancy words: OK, I want you to do staccato. And Im like, OK, I dont know what that is.\" Her vocal performance on Loud (2010) received positive reviews from music critics. James Skinner from BBC praised Rihanna vocals on the song \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\" and wrote that her voice is powerful and that \"it is Rihanna vocal – at once commanding, soulful and vulnerable – that anchors the song, and Loud itself\". Andy Gill from The Independent feels that \"California King Bed\" features her best vocal performance. In a review of Unapologetic, Billboard magazine wrote, \"Diamonds finds Rihanna doing one of her throatiest, most impassioned vocals to date, on this inspirational pop ballad.\" Jon Caramanica of the New York Times stated, \"over the years, as her game face froze in place, her voice cured into a weapon of emotional chill and strategic indifference. It decidedly unfriendly, made to give orders\". In 2023, Rolling Stone ranked Rihanna at number 68 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.  Growing up in Barbados, she mainly listened to reggae, hip hop and soca music. When she first came to the US, she was exposed to different types of music with \"rock being one of them, and I fell in love with it. [Now] I love rock music.\" During her debut, she recorded songs that were inspired by her Caribbean roots and described her early sound as \"a fusion of reggae, hip-hop and R&B, with a little something different thrown in\". Her early dancehall roots can be found on her debut album, Music of the Sun, and its follow-up, A Girl like Me. Her debut album demonstrates the influence of Rihanna musical heritage of the Caribbean. Kelefa Sanneh of the New York Times complimented its combination of dancehall and reggae, who said, \"Dancehall reggae sometimes seems like a furiously insular form of music, but ... Rihanna is only the latest singer to discover how versatile the genre spring-loaded electronic rhythms can be\". Her debut single, \"Pon de Replay\" features a dancehall-pop mixture that infuses a reggae style, while \"If It Lovin that You Want\" talks about a girl seducing a guy to be her boyfriend. Aiming for artistic growth, A Girl like Me expresses personal experiences that typical 18-year-old girls go through with ballads that were described as elegant and mature. After her second album, she slowly dismissed her dancehall and reggae roots. Rihanna musical career has been an experiment with new musical ideas and stated that she wants \"to make music that could be heard in parts of the world that Id never been to\". With its provocative subject matter and lyrics, she began incorporating a wide range of genres including, pop, R&B, reggae, dubstep, hip hop and EDM. During a review for Good Girl Gone Bad, Slant Magazine to write that Rihanna \"finally figured out that she a dance artist and the majority of the album is comprised of uptempo dance-pop [songs like]\" \"Push Up on Me\" and \"Dont Stop the Music\". It represents a departure from the Caribbean sound of her previous albums and is described as a turning point in her career. While the first half of the record shares many 1980s pop influences with songs like \"Dont Stop the Music\" and \"Shut Up and Drive\", the second half retreats into standard R&B. Recorded after the assault by her then-boyfriend, Chris Brown, Rated R had a much darker tone and was filled with various emotions she experienced throughout 2009. In her fifth album Loud, Rihanna reflects on the fun and energetic vibe she had while recording the album. The album is a mixture of ballads, party anthems and empowering love songs. Talk That Talk was similar to Rated R, as both contain hip hop, R&B, dancehall and dubstep genres. Loud and Talk That Talk saw her explore sexuality in her work (\"S&M\" and \"Birthday Cake\") and return to her dancehall roots (\"Man Down\" and \"Watch n Learn\"). She also branched out into house music with tracks like \"We Found Love\", \"Only Girl (In the World)\" and \"Complicated\". Her songs are also inspired through record sampling from other artists.  Influences Rihanna has named Madonna as her idol and biggest influence. She said that she wanted to be the \"black Madonna\" and praised her ability to reinvent herself throughout her career. She noted, \"I think that Madonna was a great inspiration for me, especially on my earlier work. If I had to examine her evolution through time, I think she reinvented her clothing style and music with success every single time. And at the same time remained a real force in entertainment in the whole world.\" Another major influence on Rihanna music and career has been Mariah Carey, whose song \"Hero\" she performed when Rihanna was still a teenager at her high school talent show. She revealed that Carey song \"Vision of Love\" \"was the song that made [her] want to do music.\" In her youth, she would see Bob Marley on television because of his fame in the Caribbean. She stated, \"He one of my favourite artists of all time – he really paved the way for every other artist out of the Caribbean\". She built a shrine in her home dedicated to the reggae legend and has covered Marley \"Is This Love\" and Bob Marley & The Wailers \"Redemption Song\" during her concert tours. During her childhood, she would go around singing Whitney Houston songs and \"A Whole New World\" into her hairbrush so much that her neighbors started calling her \"Robyn Redbreast\". She also stated that one of the first songs she remembers falling in love with was Houston version of \"I Will Always Love You\" and that it \"was really inspiring, and it made me develop a passion for music, so really, she partly responsible for me being here in this industry.\" Rihanna was also influenced by Janet Jackson, Aaliyah, Tupac, Beyoncé and Destiny Child. Other musical influences and idols include Celine Dion, Grace Jones, Lil Kim, Alicia Keys, Prince, Fefe Dobson, and Brandy. Rihanna takes influence from the different types of music she discovered when she came to America and revealed that rock music was one of the first genres she fell in love with. She commented, \"as I grow older, I want to know more about music. I want to discover more types of music\". She cited Brandy fourth studio album, Afrodisiac (2004), as her main inspiration for her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007). In her early career, her music contained strong influences of Caribbean music, including reggae and dancehall. The music video of the song \"Rude Boy\" featured images inspired by her Caribbean roots.  Videos and stage Rihanna has worked with music video director Anthony Mandler on more than a dozen music videos, the first being \"Unfaithful\" (2006). \"Weve done 16 videos together; theyre not all tough, [...] Yeah, I mean, Im known for the Disturbia and the Russian Roulette and things like that, but Only Girl (In the World) is certainly an ethereal kind of empowering, beauty-filled video,\" Mandler said. Jocelyn Vena of MTV wrote, \"Rihanna, like Madonna, also has a tendency to make truly thought-provoking music videos that fit the songs they represent. Smattered in between glitzier, more glamorous clips, Madge and Ri want us to think about bigger issues\". Jon Bream of the Star Tribune commented \"[i]n the tradition of Madonna and Janet Jackson, Rihanna has become the video vixen of the 00s ... Rihanna has perfected the pout, the long-legged strut, and trend-setting hairdos that keep women and men alike checking her out on YouTube.\" George Epaminondas of InStyle considers Rihanna music videos to be \"cinematic\" due to her \"blend of lush island rhythms and swinging pop and ... mischievous sensuality.\"  Many of her music videos were shot as short films exploring issues such as love triangles, abuse and substance abuse romance, including \"We Found Love\" and \"Man Down\". Her music video for \"Umbrella\" shows Rihanna transition into adulthood and her newly adopted image. The \"dark, creepy\" scenes of \"Disturbia\" have been compared to Michael Jackson Thriller. The video for \"Russian Roulette\" features Rihanna in a padded room playing a game of russian roulette with her partner. A scene of Rihanna being approached by a speeding car at night was compared to the altercation with Chris Brown. In 2011, Rihanna released three controversial music videos about sadomasochism, rape and domestic violence. \"Man Down\", which features Rihanna shooting a man in a train station, was criticized by the Parents Television Council. \"We Found Love\", which shows Rihanna and her love interest in a drug-filled unhealthy relationship, sparked criticism from the Rape Crisis Centre for its message. Charne Graham of the Houston Press defended her, asking, \"Why should Rihanna music videos get everyone riled up when others equally sexual and controversial videos are in rotation? [...] she just like[s] to make music videos that give us something to talk about.\" Rihanna was the first woman to pass 2 billion cumulative views on the music video website Vevo. Denis Armstrong of Canadian Online Explorer commented on her performance at the Ottawa Bluesfest, saying \"her show was a Disney-esque choreographed fantasy of non-stop hip-swiveling, sassy attitude and personal endearments and a string of funky, sugar-free hits.\" Her performance of \"Disturbia\" at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards was ranked tenth best on the MTV Video Music Awards, according to a Billboard poll. Her revealing leather costumes during her Good Girl Gone Bad Tour were highly criticized by the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, who recommended that her concert tour should be banned. Whilst commenting on her third album accompanying tour, The Times compared Rihanna stage wardrobe styling to that of Janet Jackson and called her \"a vision of Ann Summers couture in thigh-high boots and a few scraps of black PVC.\" In the October 2011 issue of British Vogue, Rihanna said her performance outfits and appearances are all an act; \"[t]hat not me. That a part I play. You know, like it a piece of art, with all these toys and textures to play with\".  Public image Known for her style and image, the media have constantly followed the evolution of Rihanna music and fashion sense. In 2009, New York magazine described Rihanna early look as that of \"a cookie-cutter teen queen\", noting she has the ability \"to shift looks dramatically and with such ease\". Around the time of the release of her second studio album, A Girl like Me (2006), many critics felt that Rihanna style, sound and musical material were too similar to those of Beyoncé. In an interview with Look magazine, Rihanna spoke about comparisons to Beyoncé: \"Beyoncé is a great artist and I feel honored to be mentioned in the same sentence, but were different performers with different styles\". She revealed during Oprah Next Chapter that Def Jam pop-princess blueprint made her feel claustrophobic during her early years with the label. According to Rihanna, \"I felt like they were giving me a blueprint. [...] They had a brand, they had an idea of what they wanted me to be without figuring out who I was.\" With the release of her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), Rihanna dismissed her innocent image for an edgier look with a new hairstyle, which was inspired by Charlize Theron bob cut in the science fiction thriller Æon Flux (2005). She followed the likes of recording artists Janet Jackson and Christina Aguilera who also shed their innocent image for an edgier look and sound. Nico Amarca of Highsnobiety magazine wrote, \"over the course of her now 10-year career, [Rihanna] has undergone one of the most significant aesthetic metamorphoses the world has ever seen\". Her image and fashion has changed several times with different hairstyles since the release of her third album. She commented that as a child she \"used to watch her [mother] get dressed\" and that her love and admiration for fashion started with her mother. When putting together her own wardrobe she stated, \"It become more about taking a risk ... I always look for the most interesting silhouette or something that a little off.\" Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian wrote that \"Rihanna wardrobe is the most talked-about, influential and dissected in pop right now\" and that whatever she wears \"is immediately reproduced on the high street, because it sells\". Country singer Miranda Lambert admires Rihanna fashion and style stating, \"I dont necessarily get inspired by the whole no-bra thing, but I love that you never know what she going to wear. It always keeps you guessing, which makes her sassy and interesting.\" In an interview with Alexa Chung during Vogue Festival 2015, Balmain designer Olivier Rousteing praised Rihanna by stylistically comparing her to some of the biggest fashion icons in music history, such as Madonna, David Bowie, Michael Jackson, and Prince. Commenting on the cultural expectation for pop stars to be role models, Rihanna said \"[being a role model] became more of my job than I wanted it to be. But no, I just want to make music. That it.\" In a May 2013 interview with MTV, The Vagina Monologues writer and feminist Eve Ensler said, \"Im a huge Rihanna fan, I think she has a kind of agency over her sexuality and she open about her sexuality, she has enormous grace and she immensely talented.\" Described as one of the sexiest women of her generation, she revealed that being a sex symbol is not a priority and that \"it definitely flattering, but also uncomfortable.\" Her appearance has landed her on the cover of magazines such as Maxim, FHM, Rolling Stone, and in December 2012, Rihanna became the first woman to be featured on the cover of GQ magazine \"Men of the Year\" issue. Rihanna made her first appearance at the Met Gala in 2007.

Legacy Rihanna is regarded by the media as a pop and fashion icon, particularly since her third studio album Good Girl Gone Bad (2007). Nick Levine of Digital Spy described Good Girl Gone Bad as \"the closest thing to a Thriller that 2007/08 is likely to produce\". According to Rolling Stone, her single \"Umbrella\" and her eighth album Anti are regarded as among the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, respectively. Her single \"Work\" has been credited by a Billboard editor for bringing the dancehall genre to the forefront of mainstream American music. Music critic Jayson Greene of Pitchfork described Rihanna as the most influential singer of the past decade, writing:\"Rihanna Voice has become an industry-wide idea, a creative property like the Korg synth or LinnDrum [...] We crave the thrill that you can only get when a dozen or so good ideas manifest themselves in a single voice. For the past 10 years, that voice has more or less been Rihanna. Now that she gleefully shredding it apart, shell probably generate a whole new comet trail of Rihannabes. Inevitably, none of them will carry the charge, the glassy cool and subterranean heat, of the real thing.\"  In August 2018, Billboard ranked Rihanna as the tenth biggest Hot 100 artist of all time, as well as the fifth biggest female act of all time. Billboard also ranked Rihanna the top Hot 100 artist of the 2010s decade.

Their relationship ended in February 2009, following their highly publicized domestic violence case. She then entered an on-again, off-again relationship with Canadian rapper Drake, which lasted from 2009 to 2016. During an interview with Rolling Stone in January 2013, Rihanna confirmed that she had rekindled her relationship with Brown, although he remained under probation for their 2009 domestic violence case. Their reunion followed persistent media speculation that occurred throughout 2012. In May 2013, Brown stated during an interview that he and Rihanna had broken up again. In 2017, Rihanna began dating Saudi businessman Hassan Jameel. They split in January 2020. On May 19, 2021, American rapper ASAP Rocky confirmed during an interview with GQ that he and Rihanna were in a relationship.

The pregnancy was confirmed in a British Vogue cover story featuring her family, which was released days after the Super Bowl appearance. On August 1, 2023, they welcomed their second son, named Riot Rose Mayers.  Domestic violence case On February 8, 2009, Rihanna scheduled performance at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards was canceled. Reports surfaced that her boyfriend at the time, Chris Brown, had physically assaulted her. He turned himself in to the police and was booked on suspicion of making criminal threats. On March 5, 2009, Brown was charged with assault and making criminal threats. Due to a leaked photograph from the police department obtained by TMZ.com—which revealed that Rihanna had sustained extensive visible injuries—an organization known as STOParazzi proposed \"Rihanna Law\", which, if enacted, would \"deter employees of law enforcement agencies from releasing photos or information that exploits crime victims.\" Gil Kaufman of VH1 reported the \"nonstop coverage of the Rihanna/Brown case has brought up a number of issues regarding the privacy of alleged victims of domestic violence, including the decision by almost all major news outlets to divulge the identity of the victim—which is not typically done in domestic-violence cases\" and discussed the controversial distribution of the leaked photograph. Rihanna was subpoenaed to testify during a preliminary hearing in Los Angeles on June 22, 2009. On June 22, 2009, Brown pleaded guilty to felony assault. Brown received five years of probation and was ordered to stay 50 yards (46 m) away from Rihanna unless at public events, which then would be reduced to 10 yards (9 m). On September 2, 2009, Brown spoke about the domestic violence case in a pre-recorded Larry King Live interview, his first public interview about the matter. He was accompanied to the interview by his mother, Joyce Hawkins, and attorney Mark Geragos, as he discussed growing up in a household with his mother being repeatedly assaulted by his stepfather. Brown said of hearing details of his assault of Rihanna, \"Im in shock, because, first of all, that not who I am as a person, and that not who I promise I want to be.\"  Awards and achievements As of September 2018, Rihanna has sold over 250 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. Throughout her career, she has received numerous awards and honors, including 9 Grammy Awards, 12 Billboard Music Awards, 13 American Music Awards, 8 People Choice Awards, among others.

              " 'Total Request Live (known commonly as TRL) is an American television program broadcast on MTV that premiered on September 14, 1998. The early version of TRL featured popular music videos played during its countdown and was also used as a promotion tool by musicians, actors, and other celebrities to promote their newest works to target the show teen demographic. During the original run of the program, TRL played the ten most requested music videos of the day, as voted on by viewers via phone or online. The show generally aired Monday through Thursday for one hour, though the scheduling and length of the show fluctuated over the years. Although TRL was billed as a live show, many episodes were prerecorded. Due to declining ratings, and the larger decline of music-based television in favor of online services, MTV announced the cancellation of TRL on September 15, 2008. The special three-hour finale episode, Total Finale Live, aired on November 16, 2008. Less than a decade later, TRL was revived on October 2, 2017. In 2019, the show aired Saturday mornings at 10:00 am ET as TRL Top 10. The show was then rebranded to Fresh Out Live.  History Origin Total Request Live originated from several pre-existing programs on MTV. Various viewer request shows, such as Dial MTV and MTV Most Wanted, had aired on the network since 1986. In 1997 and 1998, MTV launched two new shows that became the predecessors of TRL: MTV Live, which was hosted by Toby Amies, Carson Daly, and Ananda Lewis and featured live performances and interviews from musical artists, and Total Request, a viewer request show hosted by Daly.  Total Request was more subdued than MTV Live, as Daly introduced music videos from an empty, dimly lit set. As the show progressed and gained more momentum, it was added to the daytime programming during MTV Summer Share in Seaside Heights, New Jersey. The show proved to be one of the most watched and most interactive in MTV history, demonstrating that it had potential to become an even larger success.  Original run (1998–2008) Carson Daly era In September 1998, MTV producers merged the real-time aspect of MTV Live with the fan-controlled countdown aspect of Total Request into Total Request Live. The program made its debut from MTV Studios on September 14. The show then grew to become MTV unofficial flagship program. The original host of TRL, Carson Daly, brought popularity to the show. The abbreviation TRL was adopted as the official title of the show in February 1999, after Daly and Dave Holmes began using it on air regularly. In the years following, the program was rarely referred to by its original title. The show began successfully, receiving hundreds of votes for popular artists such as Hanson, Aaliyah, Blaque, TLC, Eminem, Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, Korn, Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, Janet Jackson, *NSYNC, and Backstreet Boys. TRL spent its first year developing a cult-type following. In late 1999, a live studio audience was added. By early 2000, the show reached its peak, becoming a very recognizable pop culture icon in its first two years of existence. A weekend edition of the show known as TRL Weekend, with a countdown of the week top 10 videos, aired for a short time in 2000. In 2000, MTV gradually began introducing new VJs on TRL. After winning a viewer contest to interview celebrities at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Hilarie Burton was hired as a full-time VJ. Quddus Philippe began hosting duties in May 2001 as part of MTV Summer in the Keys. The following year, both Damien Fahey and La La Vasquez began hosting duties. These VJs often co-hosted with Daly or substituted in his absence. In July 2001, MTV sponsored the Total Request Live Tour, which played over 30 dates in North America and featured acts like Destiny Child, 3LW, Jessica Simpson, Eve, and Nelly. On October 23, 2002, TRL celebrated its 1,000th episode. The number-one video on that day was \"Dirrty\" by Christina Aguilera. Also throughout 2002, original host Daly was gradually seen less often, as he had begun his own late-night talk show Last Call with Carson Daly on NBC. The show had near-daily segments from MTV News correspondents reporting on the latest in national or entertainment and music news from inside the studio.  Post-Carson Daly era In 2003, the next generation of TRL was ushered in as Carson Daly officially stepped down as host to focus on his own talk show, which premiered a year earlier on NBC. Following Daly departure, Damien Fahey, Hilarie Burton, Quddus, and La La Vasquez rotated as hosts. Later additions to the hosting roster included Vanessa Minnillo in 2003, Susie Castillo in 2005, Stephen Colletti in 2006, and Lyndsey Rodrigues in 2007. Some changes were made to TRL voting process in 2005. The show previously allowed anyone to vote online several times, but as part of these changes, only registered members of MTV.com could vote online. Additionally, a limit of one vote per day was added. Then, on July 10, 2006, MTV announced that votes would not be taken by phone, ending the use of the \"DIAL MTV\" phone number, which had been in use for voting on MTV since the premiere of the countdown show Dial MTV in the mid-1980s.  In September 2006, TRL reached its eighth anniversary and, at that point, the show was the longest-running live program that MTV had ever produced. Around this time, it began airing four days a week (Monday through Thursday), instead of all five weekdays. On November 2, 2006, the show introduced what was billed as the first-ever hip hop public service announcement on global warming. The three-minute piece, titled \"Trees\", warned about deforestation and the dangers of global warming. The video corresponded with MTV social campaign, Break the Addiction, as part of think MTV. On May 22, 2007, TRL celebrated its 2000th episode, showing highlights from the past 2000 episodes, and a special countdown of ten of the most successful videos to ever appear on the show. Justin Timberlake \"Cry Me a River\" topped the special countdown. By 2008, the only remaining hosts of TRL were Fahey and Rodrigues. Burton left TRL in 2004 after joining the cast of The WB/CW One Tree Hill. Quddus departed in 2006 and became host of TV One Access. Minnillo left in 2007 and resumed an acting career.  First cancellation In 2007, rumors began circulating that the ratings-challenged music video countdown show was to be cancelled. In early 2007, an average of 373,000 viewers regularly watched the program. New York Daily News were one of the first to publish this rumor. In February 2007, MTV said the rumor was unfounded and claimed TRL would continue to air for the foreseeable future. The producers of TRL experimented with web-based viewer interaction throughout the 2006–2007 season, showing viral videos and allowing viewers to send feedback on a video via internet forums and webcams, along with a heavy emphasis on MTV since discontinued Overdrive video portal. However, MTV still secretly planned to cancel the show and replace one with even more emphasis on viewer interaction, named YouRL (a homophone of URL.) Consequently, in July 2007, it was reported that YouRL was not received well by test audiences and the concept was abandoned. Total Request Live proceeded with a new season as usual on September 4, marking the tenth season of the show.  On September 15, 2008, it was announced that TRL would end. The final regular weekday episode aired on November 13, 2008, with guest Seth Green and The All-American Rejects.  The Rejects spent the entire episode assisting in the tear down of the set which was a theme for the episode.  At the end of the episode, Rodrigues and Fahey cooperatively added the last step in the demolition process by shutting down all the lights.  Preceding this was a montage of cast and crew members saying their goodbyes by waving to the camera. Total Finale Live, a three-hour special marking the end of the show, aired on November 16, 2008. Several artists made appearances, including Ludacris, Snoop Dogg, Nelly, Beyoncé, 50 Cent, Fall Out Boy, Backstreet Boys, Justin Timberlake, Kid Rock, JC Chasez, Christina Aguilera, Travis Barker, Taylor Swift, Hilary Duff, Eminem, and Korn Jonathan Davis. Former host Carson Daly described the media atmosphere after his departure from TRL in an interview with TV Guide: \"MySpace was sold. Social networking took off. Technology went crazy. The whole tectonic shift of mass media. There were a lot of reasons why TRL became kind of a different show after I left. I dont necessarily think it had anything to with me leaving as much as it had to do with the changing landscape.\" The last music video to be played on TRL (during the final episode) was \"...Baby One More Time\" by Britney Spears, as the video that made number one on the countdown of the most iconic videos of all time.  Final top 10 TRL chose the top ten most iconic videos and aired them as their final countdown.  Revivals (2014–2016) On June 25, 2014, MTV announced that they would bring back Total Request Live for a one-off special edition on July 2, presented by MTV personality Sway with recording artist Ariana Grande, who performed her single \"Problem\" and premiered her song \"Break Free\", as well as having her hip hop knowledge tested in a \"Hip Hop Mix Up\" game. The special was titled Total Ariana Live and was broadcast from MTV Times Square studio in front of a live audience. Grande called it \"a huge honor\" to bring back TRL. The episode drew an average of 456,000 viewers. On September 27, 2016, as part of MTV Elect This campaign, the network revived the program for a one-hour live special called Total Registration Live. It was simulcast on MTV website, app, Facebook and YouTube pages, and ElectThis.com. It was hosted by Nessa and featured performances by Ty Dolla $ign from his politically motivated mixtape Campaign. Kendall Jenner appeared in Times Square on behalf of Rock the Vote, and Ana Marie Cox and Jamil Smith from MTV News appeared on-air for segments. There were other appearances by Joss Whedon, Camila Cabello, Vic Mensa, Natalia Dyer, and Mack Wilds. Stories of millennials who have been activists were spotlighted.  MTV Classic Following the launch of MTV Classic on August 1, 2016, music video blocks have consistently aired on the network under the name Total Request Playlist. However, this is merely an automated playlist of pop, rap/hip-hop, R&B, and rock videos from the late 1990s to the 2000s.  Return (2017–2019) On July 30, 2017, MTV announced that the network would revive TRL. In addition to the hosts, Liza Koshy, The Dolan Twins, Eva Gutowski, Gabbie Hanna and Gigi Gorgeous and Jaymes Skendarian were correspondents. Since January 22, 2018, TRL has been shortened from a full hour to only a half-hour per day. The program was on hiatus until April 23, 2018. In February 2018, a half-hour late-night edition of TRL, Total Request LateNight was launched. The show aired Monday and Tuesday at 11 PM and was often an after-show for a preceding program. MTV announced plans to expand the show to three nights in the summer and four nights by the end of the year, but this never materialized. On April 23, 2018, MTV launched a pre-recorded, hour-long daily morning edition of TRL titled Total Request AM. The show aired at 8 AM and was hosted by Sway. Vinny from Jersey Shore was brought on as host for the first week and the first guests were boy band PrettyMuch. The program featured the return of a top ten countdown focusing on a specific playlist (Monday Motivation being the first countdown). 2019 saw another retooling and name change to TRL Top 10, which featured hosts Sway, Kevan Kenney and Jamila Mustafa. An offshoot of the program, Fresh Out Live, airs every Friday on MTV.  Impact TRL became \"appointment after-school TV, its studio at 1515 Broadway a pop-culture fishbowl where rabid teens could catch a glimpse of their favorite stars.\" Debuting before social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, the show is considered one \"of the first truly interactive television shows, utilizing the synergy of the internet and television to countdown the top music videos of the day.\" Among the interactive features of TRL was the video shoutout, a 15-second video clip where fans could \"appear, screen-within-screen, during the airing of a music video\" screaming about their love for an artist or band. Because TRL was initially filmed in an age before social media, the show was seen as \"the last pure view of...big celebrities. You were getting unadulterated ego.\" The show had a number of notably unscripted moments happen in studio, such as band members streaking or celebrities showing up unannounced. Taylor Hanson of Hanson, a frequent guest on TRL, said \"Before you could see what an artist had for breakfast from Twitter, TRL was the place you were going to hear about it.\" TRL not only became \"destination TV\" for young people to get news on their favorite stars and on pop culture, but also a place for viewers to stay updated with major world events as MTV News reporters would make regular appearances announcing news headlines. As MTV News correspondent SuChin Pak said, \"For young people, TRL was not only where you got to see your rock idols and pop stars, but where you connected with the major events happening around the world, outside the small town you were living in.\" The show was likened to the millennial generation version of American Bandstand or Soul Train, averaging 853,000 viewers in 1999 according to Nielsen. TRL is widely viewed as the show that launched the careers of many artists from the late 1990s and early 2000s. MTV News correspondent John Norris said, \"It an interesting debate whether NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, Britney [Spears], Christina [Aguilera], Jessica [Simpson] and Good Charlotte would have had the careers they had without TRL.\" Writing for Spin, Peter Gaston opined that TRL \"helped keep the major labels afloat by boosting pop artists sales numbers on the Billboard charts.\" TRL became a \"must-stop on every celebrity promotional itinerary.\" Musicians themselves including Eminem and Britney Spears would sometimes fill in for the hosts. The show was also the site of in-studio performances by big artists promoting album releases.  Boy bands Even though late 1990s boy bands like Backstreet Boys and NSYNC released albums before TRL began in the fall of 1998, both groups only reached their commercial peaks after their videos were seen on TRL. In 1999, the Backstreet Boys second LP, Millennium, achieved the highest first week sales ever from an LP at the time. In 2000, when NSYNC released their second LP No Strings Attached, they topped the Backstreet Boys first week sales and set a record for first-week album sales that would last for 15 years until Adele 25 surpassed the record in 2015. Fans numbering in the thousands stood outside TRL studio to see NSYNC or Backstreet Boys appear as guests, resulting in the closure of Times Square. Throughout most of 1998, 1999, and 2000, videos by the Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC would claim the top position on the countdown. Other boy bands of the era who achieved number one videos or received heavy rotation on the show included 98 Degrees, O-Town, B2K, soulDecision, and LFO.  Pop princesses Pop singers like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Mandy Moore and Jessica Simpson all made their music debuts on TRL as well. Spears, Aguilera, and Simpson would often appear as guests and their music videos would receive regular airplay. Simpson video \"Irresistible\" reached number two on the countdown in 2001. Shakira made her English-language pop debut with \"Whenever, Wherever\", and saw regular number one spot status with the songs \"Objection (Tango)\", \"La Tortura\" (the first only Spanish-speaking song to reach number one on the countdown), and \"Hips Dont Lie\". Mandy Moore saw success on the show with her debut single \"Candy\" in 1999 and \"I Wanna Be with You\", but did not score her first number-one video until her 2002 single \"Crush\". Jessica Simpson younger sister Ashlee Simpson is another pop singer that has had success on TRL. Ashlee would go on to score two videos in the number one spot with \"Boyfriend\" and \"Invisible.\" The artist with the most retired videos is Britney Spears with 13 videos retired, an honorary retired video (\"Im a Slave 4 U\"), and three videos retired number one. A \"pop princess\" streak occurred in March 2007, where the number one and number two spots were women for every show. There was no other month in the history of TRL where every show had a woman at the top spot.  Rock bands Although best known for featuring pop acts, TRL regularly featured videos and performances from rock bands in genres such as nu metal, pop punk and emo pop. The nu metal/rap metal bands Korn and Limp Bizkit were particularly popular on the program in the late 1990s, and often shared airtime with Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys. In later years, Green Day, Blink-182, My Chemical Romance, Linkin Park, Fall Out Boy and Sum 41 also were successful on the TRL chart.  Disney stars Hilary Duff was the first Disney Star in heavy rotation on MTV, She premiered \"So Yesterday\", which peaked at number one days later, and continue to top the countdown with the videos for \"Our Lips Are Sealed\", \"Fly\", \"Wake Up\", \"Beat of My Heart\" and\"With Love\" and her popularity was a determining factor for another Disney stars on TRL. Vanessa Hudgens premiered \"Come Back to Me\", which peaked at number three, and \"Say OK\", which only went to number ten. The Jonas Brothers premiered their songs \"Hold On\" and \"SOS\" on the show; \"SOS\" made it on the countdown peaking at number six. \"When You Look Me in the Eyes\" was on the charts for several weeks before peaking at number one, after fans crushed and flooded the TRL site by requesting the video hundreds of times on March 19, 2008. \"Burnin Up\" has also made it to the number-one spot on TRL. Ashley Tisdale premiered \"He Said She Said\" on TRL and it reached the number-one spot for 16 days and was retired at 40 days in the countdown, becoming the most successful song for a Disney recording artist in the show. Aly & AJ videos for \"Rush\", \"Chemicals React\" and \"Potential Breakup Song\" have all been on the countdown with \"Rush\" peaking at number two and \"Chemicals React\" peaking at number four, and \"Potential Breakup Song\" peaking at number five. Miley Cyrus \"7 Things\" premiered on TRL and reached number four on the show.  Video game A PC video game called MTV Total Request Live Trivia was developed by Hypnotix and published by Take-Two Interactive, with a release on August 14, 2001. GameRankings rated it at 53.89% acclaim, with a 48/100 grade from Metacritic.  International versions Past programs The first version of TRL outside the US was in Italy. Started on MTV Italy on 2 November 1999, it was hosted by Marco Maccarini and Giorgia Surina, followed by Federico Russo and Carolina Di Domenico. Since the 2005–06 season, Surina returned to TRL with a new co-host, Alessandro Cattelan. After the 2005–06 season, the show was hosted only by Cattelan. For the 2007–08 season, the show was hosted for the first moment by Cattelan and Elena Santarelli, and for the summer, the male host was replaced by Carlo Pastore. Later Pastore was still the main host, but the female host changed to Elisabetta Canalis. Throughout its eight seasons, TRL was broadcast from Milan, Rome, Venice, Naples, Genoa and Turin. TRL Italy is the longest-running show on MTV Italy: on 23 December 2004, a special two-hour event, \"TRL #1000\", was aired to celebrate the programme 1000th episode. From 2006 to 2012, there was also an award programme called TRL Awards where viewers chose the artist of the year via web or mobile. In the summer of 2007, a special weekly show called TRL Extra Live aired, featuring Italian singers performing a mini-concert. The final version of the programme was hosted by Brenda Lodigiani, Alessandro Arcodia, Wintana Rezene and Andrea Cadioli under the name TRL on the Road and ended on 24 September 2010.  MTV România launched the Romanian version of TRL from an Orange concept store on Calea Victoriei (a major commercial avenue in the centre of Bucharest) on 23 January 2006. The show aired two times a week on Tuesday and Wednesday. The graphics were similar to that of the Italian version. The show was cancelled in 2009. The British version, known as TRL UK, was hosted by Dave Berry, Alex Zane, Jo Good, and Maxine Akhtar. It was broadcast live from MTV Networks Europe Studios in Camden, London before moving to Leicester Square in London from second series. Following the second series broadcast from Leicester Square, the top ten countdown was removed from the show. The second series finished at the end of 2005 and the show never returned to air. The Australian version of TRL began as a weekend show, but then began airing live Monday through Friday. It was hosted by Maz Compton, Lyndsey Rodrigues, Nathan Sapsford, and Jason Robert Dundas. In early 2006, it returned to airing only on Friday evenings. The show was cancelled at the end of 2006 and was replaced by \"The Lair\". A revival of TRL returned in 2019. It is hosted by Ash London, Angus OLoughlin, Flex Mami, and Lisa Hamilton. After a Polish version of TRL was unsuccessful, MTV Poland decided to launch a new chart show based on TRL structure titled RMF MAXXX Hits, which aired from Monday to Saturday at 2 pm. MTV France launched the French version (Ton Request Live) of the US show on 24 January 2007. The format was different from the original concept: there was no video countdown and each episode included a film mini-documentaries entitled \"TRL en Movies\". The show closed after only a single episode on 25 January 2007. The German version of TRL was very successful throughout Europe (after Italy), and it was known as Total Request Live Germany. TRL Germany had the highest television ratings of all the TRL versions in Europe. The show was hosted by Joko Winterscheidt and Mirjam Weichselbraun or Patrice Bouédibéla from Tuesday to Friday from 4:30 to 5:30 pm, and it was divided in four versions: Urban TRL (hip-hop music), Rock TRL (rock music), regular TRL (various genres), and TRL XXL (special live guest). It was replaced with MTV Home in Summer 2009.  Similar programs In Latin America, a version of TRL called Los 10+ Pedidos (The 10 Most Requested) airs daily. The show is hosted by \"Gabo\" and \"Macarena\". MTV Tr3s, a US channel targeted to bilingual Latino people, premiered Mi TRL in September 2006. The show carried the same format and graphics as the English-language version of TRL. Mi TRL was initially anchored by Carlos Santos and Susie Castillo, with Santos later being replaced by Denise Ramerez. MTV News segments on the show are delivered from Los Angeles by correspondent Liz Hernandez. The show was cancelled along with TRL in November 2008. Viacom sister channel BET featured its own urban-oriented countdown, 106 & Park, and the two shows frequently competed with one another for guests, though by the end of the run of TRL, both shows aired with some space between them, allowing guests to appear on both shows on the same day. TeenNick featured a kid-friendly rendition of TRL called TeenNick Top 10.  See also TRL Number Ones  References Further reading Jackman, Ian (2000). Total Request Live: The Ultimate Fan Guide.

              " 'Céline Marie Claudette Dion  ( say-LEEN dee-ON; born 30 March 1968) is a Canadian singer. Referred to as the \"Queen of Power Ballads\", she is noted for her powerful and technically skilled vocals. Her music has incorporated genres such as pop, rock, R&B, gospel, and classical music. Her recordings have been mainly in English and French, although she has also sung in several other languages. Born into a large family in Charlemagne, Quebec, Dion was discovered by her future manager and husband, René Angélil, and emerged as a teen star in her home country with a series of French-language albums during the 1980s. She gained international recognition by winning the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest, where she represented Switzerland with \"Ne partez pas sans moi\". Her debut English-language album, Unison (1990), established her as a viable pop artist primarily in North America and several English-speaking markets, while The Colour of My Love (1993) gave her global superstardom. Dion continued her success throughout the 1990s with several of the bestselling albums in history, such as Falling into You (1996) and Let Talk About Love (1997), which were certified diamond in the US with more than 30 million sales worldwide each. She also released a series of international number-one hits, including \"The Power of Love\", \"Think Twice\", \"To Love You More\", \"Because You Loved Me\", \"It All Coming Back to Me Now\", \"Im Your Angel\", \"That the Way It Is\", \"Im Alive\" and \"My Heart Will Go On\", the theme for the 1997 film Titanic, which solidified her popularity. Dion continued releasing French-language albums between each English record; Deux (1995) became the best-selling French-language album of all time, while Sil suffisait daimer (1998), Sans attendre (2012), and Encore un soir (2016), were all certified diamond in France. During the 2000s, she built her reputation as a successful live performer with A New Day... on the Las Vegas Strip (2003–07), the highest-grossing concert residency of all time, and the Taking Chances World Tour (2008–09), one of the highest-grossing concert tours of the 2000s. In 2009, she was named by the Los Angeles Times as the top-earning artist of the decade, with combined album sales and concert revenue exceeding $747 million. In 2022, Dion canceled a tour due to her diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome, a rare neurological disease. With 200 million records sold worldwide, Dion is the best-selling Canadian recording artist, the best-selling French-language artist, and one of the best-selling musical artists of all time. She is the sixth most successful female artist in the history of US Billboard 200 and received recognition from the IFPI for selling over 50 million albums in Europe. Seven of her albums have sold at least 10 million copies worldwide, the second most among women in history. She was ranked as the fourth most outstanding pop vocalist by Cover Magazine and the ninth greatest voice in music by MTV. One of the highest-grossing touring artists in history, she is the second woman to accumulate US$1 billion in concert revenue. According to Forbes, Dion was the world highest-paid female musician in 1997, 1998, 2004, and 2006. Dion has also received two honorary doctorates in music degree from Berklee College of Music and Université Laval.  Life and career 1968–1989: Early life and career beginnings Dion was born in Charlemagne, Quebec, 24 kilometres (15 mi) northeast of Montreal, the youngest of 14 children of Thérèse (née Tanguay, 1927–2020), a homemaker, and Adhémar Dion (1923–2003), a butcher, both of French descent. She was raised a Roman Catholic in a poor but, by her own account, happy home in Charlemagne. Music had always been a major part of the Dion family, and she was named after the song \"Céline\", which French singer Hugues Aufray had recorded two years before her birth. On 13 August 1973, she made her first public appearance at her brother Michel wedding, where she performed Christine Charbonneau song \"Du fil, des aiguilles et du coton\". She continued to perform with her siblings in her parents small piano bar called Le Vieux Baril, \"The Old Barrel\". She suffered a number of accidents as a young child, including an incident at five years old when she was struck by a car as her father and brother Clément looked on. She was hospitalized briefly with a concussion. From an early age, she had dreamed of being a performer. In a 1994 interview with People, she recalled, \"I missed my family and my home, but I dont regret having lost my adolescence. I had one dream: I wanted to be a singer.\" As a child in Quebec, Dion participated in Girl Guide programs as a member of Girl Guides of Canada. At age 12, she collaborated with her mother and her brother Jacques to write and compose her first song, \"Ce nétait quun rêve\", whose title translates as \"It Was Only a Dream\" or \"Nothing But A Dream\". Michel sent the recording to music manager René Angélil, whose name he discovered on the back of a Ginette Reno album. Angélil was moved to tears by Dion voice and decided to make her a star. In 1981, he mortgaged his home to fund her first record, La voix du bon Dieu, which later became a local No. 1 hit and made her an instant star in Quebec. Her popularity spread to other parts of the world when she competed in the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival in Tokyo and won the musician award for \"Top Performer\" as well as the gold medal for \"Best Song\" with \"Tellement jai damour pour toi\". By 1983, in addition to becoming the first Canadian artist to receive a gold record in France for the single \"Damour ou damitié\" (\"Of Love or of Friendship\"), Dion had also won several Félix Awards, including \"Best Female performer\" and \"Discovery of the Year\". Further success came when she represented Switzerland in the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest with the song \"Ne partez pas sans moi\" and won the contest by a close margin in Dublin. At age 18, after seeing a Michael Jackson performance, Dion told Angélil she wanted to be a star like Jackson. Though confident in her talent, Angélil realized her image needed to be changed for her to be marketed worldwide. She withdrew from the spotlight for a number of months, during which she underwent dental surgery to improve her appearance, and was sent to the École Berlitz in 1989 to improve her English. In 1989, during a concert on the Incognito tournée, she injured her voice. She consulted the otorhinolaryngologist William Gould, who gave her an ultimatum: have immediate surgery on her vocal cords or do not utilize them at all for three weeks. Dion chose the latter and underwent vocal training with William Riley.  1990–1992: Unison, Dion chante Plamondon, and Celine Dion Two years after she learned English, Dion made her debut into the Anglophone market with Unison (1990), the lead single having originally been recorded by English singer Junior in 1983 and later Laura Branigan. She incorporated the help of producers including Vito Luprano and David Foster. The album was largely influenced by 1980s soft rock music and quickly found a niche within the adult contemporary radio format. Unison also hit the right notes with critics: Jim Farber of Entertainment Weekly wrote her vocals were \"tastefully unadorned\", and she never attempted to \"bring off styles that are beyond her\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared it \"a fine, sophisticated American debut\". Singles from the album included \"(If There Was) Any Other Way\", \"The Last to Know\", \"Unison\", and \"Where Does My Heart Beat Now\", a mid-tempo soft-rock ballad made prominent use of the electric guitar. The latter became her first top-ten hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number four. In 1991, Dion was a featured soloist on \"Voices That Care\", a tribute to American troops fighting in Operation Desert Storm. Her real international breakthrough came when she duetted with Peabo Bryson on the title track to Disney animated film Beauty and the Beast (1991). It became her first top-ten hit in the UK and her second top-ten hit in the United States. The song earned its songwriters an Academy Award for Best Song and gave Dion her first Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. \"Beauty and the Beast\" served as the lead single from her 1992 self-titled album, which, like her debut, had a strong pop rock influence combined with elements of soul and classical music. Owing to the success of the lead-off single and her collaborations with David Foster and Diane Warren, the album was even more well-received commercially than Unison; it was certified diamond in Canada and double platinum in the U.S. The album second single \"If You Asked Me To\" (a cover of Patti LaBelle song from the 1989 movie Licence to Kill) became her first number-one single in Canada and peaked at number four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. Also during this time, Dion released the Francophone album Dion chante Plamondon. The album consisted mostly of covers, but featured four new songs: \"Des mots qui sonnent\", \"Je danse dans ma tête\", \"Quelquun que jaime, quelquun qui maime\", and \"Lamour existe encore\". It was originally released in Canada and France during the 1991–1992 period, then later received an international release in 1994, the first French Celine Dion album to do so. \"Un garçon pas comme les autres (Ziggy)\" became a smash hit in France, reaching No. 2 and being certified gold. In Quebec, the album was certified Gold the day it was released. By 1992, Unison, Celine Dion, and numerous high-profile media appearances had propelled Dion to superstardom in North America. She had achieved one of her main objectives: wedging her way into the Anglophone market and achieving fame. However, while she was experiencing rising success in the U.S., her French fans in Canada criticized her for neglecting them. She would later rebuff these criticisms at the 1991 Félix Awards show, where, after winning \"English Artist of the Year\", she openly declined the award. She asserted she was—and would always be—a French, not an English, artist. Indeed, to this day she speaks English with a noticeable Quebec French accent. Apart from her commercial success, there were also changes in her personal life, as Angélil, who was 26 years her senior, transitioned from manager to lover. However, the relationship was kept a secret as they both feared the public would find it inappropriate.  1993–1995: The Colour of My Love and Deux In 1993, Dion announced her feelings for her manager by declaring him \"the colour of [her] love\" in the dedication section of her third English-language album The Colour of My Love. However, instead of criticizing their relationship as she had feared, fans embraced the couple. Eventually, Angélil and Dion married in an extravagant wedding ceremony on 17 December 1994, which was broadcast live on Canadian television. As with most of her catalogue, The Colour of My Love had over-riding themes of love and romance. It became her most successful record up to point, selling more than six million copies in the U.S., two million in Canada, and peaking at No. 1 in many countries. The album also spawned Dion first US, Canadian, and Australian No. 1 single \"The Power of Love\" (a remake of Jennifer Rush 1985 hit), which would become her signature hit in various nations until she reached new career heights in the late 1990s. The single \"When I Fall in Love\", a duet with Clive Griffin, achieved moderate success on the U.S. and Canadian charts and was nominated for two Grammy Awards, winning one. The Colour of My Love also became Dion first major hit in Europe, particularly in the United Kingdom. Both the album and the single \"Think Twice\" simultaneously occupied the top of the British charts for five consecutive weeks. \"Think Twice\", which remained at No. 1 for seven weeks, eventually became the fourth single by a female artist to sell in excess of one million copies in the UK while the album was eventually certified five-times platinum for two million copies sold. Dion kept to her French roots and continued to release many Francophone recordings between each English record. Generally, they achieved more credibility than her English-language works. She released À lOlympia, a live album recorded during one of her concerts at the Paris Olympia in 1994. It had one promotional single, a live version of \"Calling You\", which peaked at seventy-five on the French Singles Chart. She also recorded a bilingual version of \"Petit Papa Noël\" with Alvin and the Chipmunks for the 1994 holiday album A Very Merry Chipmunk. Deux (also known as The French Album in the United States), was released in 1995, and it would go on to become the best-selling French-language album of all time. The album was mostly written and produced by Jean-Jacques Goldman, and amassed huge success with the singles \"Pour que tu maimes encore\" and \"Je sais pas\". \"Pour que tu maimes encore\" reached No. 1 in France and stayed at the top position for twelve weeks. It was later certified Platinum in France. The single reached the top ten in the UK and Ireland, a rare accomplishment for a French song. The second single off the album, \"Je sais pas\", reached No. 1 on the French Singles Chart as well and was certified Silver there. During the mid-1990s and onward, Dion albums were generally constructed on the basis of melodramatic soft rock ballads, with sprinklings of up-tempo pop and rare forays into other genres. She collaborated with writers and producers such as Jim Steinman and David Foster, who helped her to develop a signature sound. While critical reviews fluctuated, her releases performed increasingly well on the international charts, and in 1996, she won the World Music Award for \"World Best-selling Female Recording Artist of the Year\" for the third time. By the mid-1990s, she had established herself as one of the best-selling artists in the world.  1996–1999: Falling into You, Let Talk About Love, and Sil suffisait daimer In the five years since her debut English language album in 1990, Billboard stated she had already sold 40 million albums worldwide. Falling into You (1996), Dion fourth English-language album, presented Dion at the height of her popularity and showed a further progression of her music. In an attempt to reach a wider audience, the album combined many elements, such as complex orchestral sounds, African chanting, and elaborate musical effects. Additionally, instruments like the violin, Spanish guitar, trombone, the cavaquinho, and saxophone created a new sound. The singles encompassed a variety of musical styles. The title track \"Falling into You\" and \"River Deep – Mountain High\" (a Tina Turner cover) made prominent use of percussion instruments; \"It All Coming Back to Me Now\" (produced by its writer, Jim Steinman) and a remake of Eric Carmen \"All by Myself\" maintained a soft-rock atmosphere, combined with the classical sound of the piano; and the No. 1 single \"Because You Loved Me\", which was written by Diane Warren, was a pop ballad served as the theme to the 1996 film Up Close and Personal. Falling into You garnered career-best reviews for Dion. While Dan Leroy wrote it was not very different from her previous work with Stephen Holden of The New York Times and Natalie Nichols of the Los Angeles Times writing the album was \"formulaic\", other critics, such as Chuck Eddy of Entertainment Weekly, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, and Daniel Durchholz, lavished the album as \"compelling\", \"passionate\", \"stylish\", \"elegant\", and \"remarkably well-crafted\". Falling into You became Dion most critically and commercially successful album, topping the charts in many countries and becoming one of the best-selling albums of all time. In 2013, CBC Music ranked Falling into You 33rd in their list of the 100 greatest Canadian albums ever. In the United States, the album reached No. 1, and was later certified 12× Platinum for over 12 million copies shipped. In Canada, the album was certified diamond for over one million copies shipped. The IFPI certified Falling into You 9× Platinum, an accolade has been given to only two other albums in history, with one of the two being Dion own album, Let Talk About Love. The album also won Grammy Awards for Best Pop Album and the academy highest honour, Album of the Year. Dion was asked to perform \"The Power of the Dream\" at the opening ceremony of the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games. In March 1996, she launched the Falling into You Tour in support of her new album, performing concerts around the world for over a year.   She followed Falling into You with Let Talk About Love (1997), which was publicized as its sequel. The recording process took place in London, New York City, and Los Angeles, and featured a host of special guests, such as Barbra Streisand on \"Tell Him\"; the Bee Gees on \"Immortality\"; and tenor Luciano Pavarotti on \"I Hate You Then I Love You\". Other musicians included Carole King, George Martin, Bryan Adams and Jamaican singer Diana King, who added a reggae tinge to \"Treat Her Like a Lady\". Let Talk About Love was another major success, reaching No. 1 all over the world, attaining platinum status in twenty-four sales territories, and becoming the fastest selling album of her career. In the United States, the album topped the chart in its seventh week of release, and was later certified 11× Platinum in the U.S. for over 11 million copies shipped. In Canada, the album sold 230,212 copies in its first week of release, which remains a record. It was eventually certified diamond in Canada for over one million copies shipped. The most successful single from the album was the classically influenced ballad \"My Heart Will Go On\", which was written and composed by James Horner and Will Jennings, and produced by Horner and Walter Afanasieff. Serving as the love theme for the 1997 blockbuster film Titanic, the song topped the charts across the world and became Dion signature song. Horner and Jennings won the Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Original Song, while Dion herself garnered two Grammy Awards for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and the most coveted, Record of the Year, (the song itself won four awards, but two were presented to the songwriters). \"My Heart Will Go On\" and \"Think Twice\" made her the only female artist in the UK to have two singles to sell more than a million copies. In support of her album, she embarked on the Let Talk About Love Tour between 1998 and 1999. Dion ended the 1990s with three more extremely successful albums: the Christmas album These Are Special Times (1998), the French-language album, Sil suffisait daimer, and the compilation album All the Way... A Decade of Song (1999). On These Are Special Times, she co-wrote the song \"Dont Save It All for Christmas Day\" along with Ric Wake and Peter Zizzo. The album was her most classically influenced yet, with orchestral arrangements found on virtually every track. The album featured the single \"Im Your Angel\" (a duet with R. Kelly), which became her fourth US No. 1 single, and a smash hit across the world. The album second single \"The Prayer\" (a duet with Andrea Bocelli) served as the soundtrack of the 1998 film Quest for Camelot and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. All the Way... A Decade of Song drew together her most successful hits coupled with seven new songs, including the lead-off single \"That the Way It Is\", a cover of Roberta Flack \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\", and \"All the Way\", a duet with Frank Sinatra. All the Way became one of the best-selling compilation albums of all time, reaching No. 1 in the United States for three weeks. The album was later certified 7× Platinum in the U.S. for 7 million copies shipped. It also topped the charts in the UK, Canada, and Australia. Her last French-language studio album of the 1990s, Sil suffisait daimer, was very successful as well, topping the charts in every major French-speaking country, including France, Switzerland, the Wallonia region of Belgium, and Canada. In France, the album was certified diamond, selling 1.5 million copies. By the end of the 1990s, Dion had sold more than 130 million records worldwide, and had won a slew of industry awards. Her status as one of the music industry biggest pop divas was further solidified when she was asked to perform on VH1 Divas Live special in 1998, with superstars Aretha Franklin, Gloria Estefan, Shania Twain, and Mariah Carey. That year, she also received two of the highest Canadian honours: \"Officer of the Order of Canada for Outstanding Contribution to the World of Contemporary Music\" and \"Officer of the National Order of Quebec\". A year later, she was inducted into the Canadian Broadcast Hall of Fame, and was honoured with a star on Canada Walk of Fame. Starting from the mid-1990s, the pop rock influence more noticeable in her earlier releases was replaced by a more mature feel. Additionally, the recurring theme of \"love\" dominated most of her releases, which led to some critics dismissing her music as banal. Other critics, like Elysa Gardner and Jose F. Promis, praised her voice during this period, describing it as a \"technical marvel\". Steve Dollar, in his review of These Are Special Times, opined Dion was a \"vocal Olympian for whom there aint no mountain—or scale—high enough\".  2000–2003: Hiatus, A New Day Has Come, One Heart, and 1 fille & 4 types After releasing and promoting thirteen albums during the 1990s, Dion stated she needed to settle down, and announced on her latest album All the Way... A Decade of Song, she needed to take a step back from the spotlight and enjoy life. Angélil diagnosis with esophageal cancer also prompted her to hiatus. While on break, she was unable to escape the spotlight. In 2000, the National Enquirer published a false story about Dion. Brandishing a picture of Dion and her husband, the magazine misquoted her, printing the headline, \"Celine — Im Pregnant With Twins!\" She sued the magazine for more than $20 million. The editors printed an apology and a full retraction in the next issue, and donated money to the American Cancer Society in honour of her and her husband. A year after the incident, after undergoing fertility treatments, she gave birth to a son, René-Charles Dion Angélil, on 25 January 2001, in Florida. Following the 11 September attacks, Dion returned to the music scene, and in a televised performance sang \"God Bless America\" at the benefit concert America: A Tribute to Heroes. Chuck Taylor of Billboard wrote, \"the performance ... brings to mind what has made her one of the celebrated vocalists of our time: the ability to render emotion that shakes the soul. Affecting, meaningful, and filled with grace, this is a musical reflection to share with all of us still searching for ways to cope.\" She performed it again in 2003 during pregame festivities for Super Bowl XXXVII in Qualcomm Stadium. In December 2001, she published her autobiography, My Story, My Dream, which chronicled her rags-to-riches story. Dion ended her three-year sabbatical from the music industry with the aptly titled album A New Day Has Come, released in March 2002. The album was her most personal yet, with songs focusing on her motherhood and maturation as a woman such as \"A New Day Has Come\", and \"Goodbye (The Saddest Word)\". She stated: \"Becoming a mother makes you a grown-up.\" She also stated: \"A New Day Has Come, for Rene, for me, is the baby. It has everything to do with the baby ... The song \"A New Day Has Come\" represents very well the mood Im feeling right now. It represents the whole album.\" A New Day Has Come debuted at No. 1 in more than 17 countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada. In the United States, the album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 527,000 copies; marking her first No. 1 debut on the chart, as well as the highest debut sales week of her career in the U.S. It was eventually certified 3× Platinum in the United States, and 6× Platinum in Canada. While the album was commercially successful, critical reviews suggested it was \"forgettable\" and the lyrics were \"lifeless\". Both Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone, and Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly, stated Dion music had not developed much during her break, and classed her material as trite and mediocre. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the album \"a lengthy collection of drippy, gooey pop fluffer-nutter\". The first single off the album, A New Day Has Come peaked at No.22 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, being an airplay-only release. On the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks, however, the song spent 21 consecutive weeks at No. 1, breaking the record for the longest span at the top. The previous record holders were Phil Collins Youll Be in My Heart and Dion own Because You Loved Me, both of which lasted nineteen weeks at No. 1. The album next single, \"Im Alive\", was featured on the soundtrack for Stuart Little 2 (2002), and was ranked number 2 on the European Hot 100 Singles, and number 6 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks in the United States. During 2002, she performed for many benefit concerts, including her second appearance on VH1 Divas Live, a concert to benefit the VH1 Save The Music Foundation, alongside Cher, Anastacia, Dixie Chicks, Mary J. Blige, Whitney Houston, Cyndi Lauper, Shakira, and Stevie Nicks. In conjunction with an endorsement deal with Chrysler, she released One Heart (2003), an album representing her appreciation for life. The album largely consisted of pop and dance music—a deviation from the soaring, melodramatic ballads, for which she had been known. Although the album achieved moderate success, One Heart was met with mixed criticism, and words such as \"predictable\" and \"banal\" appeared even in the most lenient reviews. A cover of the 1989 Cyndi Lauper hit \"I Drove All Night\", released to launch her advertising campaign with Chrysler, incorporated elements of dance-pop and rock and roll. The advertising deal was met with criticism, with some stating Dion was trying to cater to her sponsors. After One Heart, she released her next English-language studio album, Miracle (2004). Miracle was a multimedia project conceived by Dion and Australian photographer Anne Geddes and had a theme centring on babies and motherhood. The album was filled with lullabies and other songs of maternal love and inspiration, including covers of Louis Armstrong \"What a Wonderful World\" and John Lennon \"Beautiful Boy\". The reviews for Miracle were mixed. Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album three of out five stars, stating, \"The worst you can say about the record is that there are no surprises, but the audience for this record doesnt want surprises; they want comfort, whether it arrives in polished music or artsy photos of newborns, and Miracle provides both, which makes it appealing for those expectant or new mothers in Dion audience.\" Chuck Taylor of Billboard wrote the single \"Beautiful Boy\" was \"an unexpected gem\" and called Dion \"a timeless, enormously versatile artist\", Chuck Arnold of People, however, labelled the album as excessively sentimental, while Nancy Miller of Entertainment Weekly opined that \"the whole earth-mama act is just opportunism, reborn\". Miracle debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 chart and No. 1 in Canada and was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA. The francophone album 1 fille & 4 types (1 Girl & 4 Guys), released in October 2003, fared better than her previous two releases and showed her trying to distance herself from the \"diva\" image. She recruited Jean-Jacques Goldman, Gildas Arzel, Eric Benzi, and Jacques Veneruso, with whom she had previously worked on two of her best-selling French albums Sil suffisait daimer and Deux. Labeled \"the album of pleasure\" by Dion herself, the album cover showed her in a simple and relaxed manner, contrary to the choreographed poses usually found on her album covers. The album achieved widespread commercial success in France, Canada, and Belgium where it reached No. 1. In France, the album debuted at No. 1 and was later certified 2× platinum after selling over 700,000 copies. Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote Dion vocals were \"back at top of their game\" and she was \"getting back to pop basics and performing at a level unheard in a while\". Though her albums were commercially successful, they did not achieve the sales or the reception of her previous works. Her songs received less airplay as radio became less embracing of balladeers like Dion, Carey, and Houston, and was focused on more up-tempo, urban/hip-hop songs. By 2004, Dion had accumulated sales of more than 175 million albums worldwide and received the Chopard Diamond Award from the World Music Awards for her achievements. According to the official World Music Awards website, the award is rare; it is \"not presented every year\" and an artist can be presented with the award only for selling \"over 100 million albums during their career\".  2003–2007: A New Day... In early 2002, Dion announced a three-year, 600-show contract to appear five nights a week in an entertainment extravaganza, A New Day..., at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace. This move was generally seen as risky, but journalist Miriam Nunzio wrote it was \"one of the smartest business decisions in years by any major recording artist\". Dion conceived the show after seeing O by Franco Dragone during her break from recording, and it premiered on 25 March 2003, in a 4,000-seat arena specifically designed for her show and modelled after the Roman Colosseum. Many stars attended the opening night including Dick Clark, Alan Thicke, Kathy Griffin, Lance Bass, and Justin Timberlake, who hosted the television special. The show, directed by Dragone and choreographed by Mia Michaels, was a combination of dance, music, and visual effects. It included Dion performing her biggest hits against an array of dancers and special effects. Reviewer Mike Weatherford felt that, at first, Dion was not as relaxed as she should be, and at times, it was hard to find her among the excessive stage ornamentation and dancers. However, he noted the show had become more enjoyable over the course of its run, because of her improved stage-presence and simplified costumes. The show was well received by audiences; it routinely sold out until its end in late 2007. Ticket prices averaged  US $135.33. According to Pollstar, Dion sold 322,000 tickets and grossed US $43.9 million in the first half of 2005, and by July 2005, she had sold out 315 out of 384 shows. By the end of 2005, she grossed more than US $76 million, placing sixth on Billboard Money Makers list for 2005. Because of the show success, her contract was extended into 2007 for an undisclosed sum. On 5 January 2007, it was announced the show would end on 15 December 2007, with tickets for the period after October 2007 having gone on sale from 1 March. According to Billboard, A New Day... is the most successful residency of all time, grossing over US$385 million ($565.73 million in 2023 dollars) and drawing nearly three million people to 717 shows. The Live in Las Vegas: A New Day... DVD was released on 10 December 2007, in Europe and the following day in North America.  2007–2010: Delles, Taking Chances, and Taking Chances Tour On 21 May 2007, Dion released the French-language album Delles (About Them), which debuted at the top of the Canadian album charts, selling 72,200 copies in its first week. It marked her tenth No. 1 album in the SoundScan era, and her eighth debut at the top position. In Canada, the album has been certified 2× platinum, and within the first month had already shipped half a million units worldwide. DElles also reached No. 1 in France and Belgium. The first single \"Et sil nen restait quune (je serais celle-là)\" (meaning \"And If There Was Only One Woman Left (I Would Be That One)\") debuted at the top of the French singles chart a month earlier. Later in same year, she released the English album Taking Chances on 12 November in Europe, and 13 November in North America. Her first English studio album since 2003 One Heart, it featured pop, R&B, and rock inspired music. For this album, she collaborated with John Shanks and ex-Evanescence guitarist Ben Moody, as well as Kristian Lundin, Peer Åström, Linda Perry, Japanese singer Yuna Ito, and R&B singer and songwriter Ne-Yo. Dion stated, \"I think this album represents a positive evolution in my career ... Im feeling strong, maybe a little gutsier than in the past, and just as passionate about music and life as I ever was.\" She launched her year-long global Taking Chances Tour on 14 February 2008 in South Africa, performing 132 dates in stadiums and arenas across 5 continents. The Taking Chances Tour was a great success in the United States, reaching the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Boxscore, having sold out every concert in the U.S. and Canada. In addition, she appeared on Idol Gives Back for a second year in a row. Dion was nominated for six Juno Awards in 2008, adding to her 53 previous nominations (an all-time record). Her nominations included Artist of the Year, Pop Album of the Year (for Taking Chances), Francophone Album of the Year (for Delles) and Album of the Year (for both Taking Chances and Delles). The following year, she was nominated for 3 Juno Awards including the Fan Choice Award, Song of the Year (for \"Taking Chances\"), and Music DVD of the Year (for Live in Las Vegas: A New Day...)  On 22 August 2008, Dion presented a free outdoor concert, mostly in French, on the Plains of Abraham, for the 400th anniversary of Quebec City. The celebration gathered approximately 490,000 people. The concert, called Céline sur les Plaines, was released on DVD on 11 November 2008, in Quebec and was released on 20 May 2009, in France. Late October 2008 saw the worldwide release of a comprehensive English-language greatest hits album, My Love: Essential Collection. In May 2009, Dion was named the 20th best-selling artist of the decade and the second-best-selling female artist of the decade in the United States, selling an estimated 17.57 million copies of her albums there since 2000. In June 2009, Forbes reported she earned $100 million during 2008. In December 2009, Pollstar announced she was the highest-grossing solo live music act in North America of the decade, second overall behind only the Dave Matthews Band. She grossed $522.2 million during the decade, a large portion of the sum coming from her five-year residency at Caesars Palace. In January 2010, the Los Angeles Times presented its annual list of the top ten largest earners of the year, revealing Dion took the top spot for the entire decade, with $747.9 million in total revenue from 2000 to 2009. The largest haul came from ticket sales, totalling $522.2 million. Additionally, she was named \"Artist of the Decade\" in Quebec, announced by Le Journal de Québec in December 2009. A public online survey asked responders to vote for whom they believe deserved the above-mentioned accolade. On 17 February 2010, Dion released into theatres a documentary film about her Taking Chances Tour, titled, Celine: Through the Eyes of the World. The documentary shows behind-the-scenes footage of her both onstage and offstage, along with footage of her with her family as they travelled the world with her. The distributor is the Sony Pictures subsidiary, Hot Ticket. The film was later released on Blu-ray and DVD on 4 May 2010, along with the CD/DVD, Taking Chances World Tour: The Concert. At the 52nd Grammy Awards in February 2010, Dion joined Carrie Underwood, Usher, Jennifer Hudson, and Smokey Robinson to perform the song \"Earth Song\" during the 3-D Michael Jackson tribute. Furthermore, in a May 2010 Harris Poll, Dion was named the most popular musician in the United States, ahead of U2, Elvis Presley, and The Beatles while factoring in gender, political affiliations, geographic region of residence, and income. Specifically, she was the most popular musician in the female demographic, as well as among all Democrats, those who live in the eastern United States and southern United States, and those who have incomes between US$35k and US$74.9k. In September 2010, she released the single \"Voler\", a duet with French singer Michel Sardou. The song was later included on Sardou album. In addition, it was announced in October 2010 Dion wrote and composed a new song for Canadian singer, Marc Dupré entitled \"Entre deux mondes\".  2011–2014: Celine, Sans attendre, and Loved Me Back to Life In an interview with People published in February 2010, Dion announced she would be returning to Caesars Palace for Celine, a three-year residency for seventy shows a year, beginning 15 March 2011.

On 21 May 2021, it was announced Dion would return to Las Vegas, in November of the same year, for a limited-run installment of ten dates in collaboration with Resorts World Las Vegas. Billboard listed Dion as the third top paid musician of 2020 (second by female artist), with total of earnings of $17.5 million. Dion contributed vocals to the song \"Superwoman\" on Diane Warren 2021 album Diane Warren: The Cave Sessions Vol. 1.  2022–present: Health problems and acting debut On 15 January 2022, Dion canceled her North American tour dates because of severe muscle spasms. On 8 December, Dion announced she had been diagnosed with stiff-person syndrome, a rare neurological disease. She said the disease affected every aspect of her life, making it difficult to walk, and affected her vocal cords. All her tour dates were cancelled. On 25 June, 2024, Amazon MGM Studios released a documentary about Dion life with stiff-person syndrome, I Am: Celine Dion. The I Am: Celine Dion soundtrack was released on 21 June. In 2023, Dion starred as herself in Love Again, her first acting appearance in a feature film. She also recorded five new songs for the soundtrack, released on 12 May; the first single, \"Love Again\" premiered on 13 April. On 3 May, a mashup remix of Dion \"Im Alive\" and the Whispers 1979 song \"And the Beat Goes On\" was released. The single, by Majestic, the Jammin Kid, also includes Dion as a lead credit. The single debuted at number 6 on the UK Singles Downloads Chart.  Artistry Influences Dion cites idols as varied as Michael Jackson, Aretha Franklin, Charles Aznavour, Carole King, Anne Murray, Barbra Streisand, Whitney Houston and the Bee Gees, most of whom she would eventually collaborate with. Michael Jackson in particular was a major motivation for her to learn English as early as in the 1980s. Her music has been influenced by numerous genres, including pop, rock, gospel, R&B, and soul, and her lyrics focus on themes of poverty, world hunger, and spirituality, with an emphasis on love and romance. After the birth of her first child, her work increasingly focused on maternal love.  Musical style Dion has faced considerable criticism from critics, who state that her music often retreats behind pop and soul conventions, and is marked by excessive sentimentality. According to Keith Harris of Rolling Stone magazine, \"[Dion] sentimentality is bombastic and defiant rather than demure and retiring ... [she] stands at the end of the chain of drastic devolution that goes Aretha–Whitney–Mariah. Far from being an aberration, Dion actually stands as a symbol of a certain kind of pop sensibility—bigger is better, too much is never enough, and the riper the emotion the more true.\" Her francophone releases, by contrast, tend to be deeper and more varied than her English releases, and consequently have achieved more credibility. Critics have stated that Dion involvement in the production aspect of her music is fundamentally lacking, which results in her work being overproduced and impersonal. However, coming from a family in which all of her siblings were musicians, she dabbled in learning how to play instruments like piano and guitar, and practised with a Fender Stratocaster during the recording sessions for her album Falling into You. Occasionally, Dion has contributed to the writing of a handful of her English and French songs, as well as writing a few songs for other artists such as Marc Dupre. Additionally, as her career progressed, she found herself taking charge in the production of her albums. On her first English album, which she recorded before she had a firm command of the English language, she expressed disapproval, which could have been avoided if she had assumed more creative input. By the time she released her second English album Celine Dion, she assumed more control of the production and recording process, hoping to dispel earlier criticisms. She stated, \"On the second album I said, Well, I have the choice to be afraid one more time and not be 100% happy, or not be afraid and be part of this album. This is my album.\" Besides her contributions to some of her early French albums, Dion wrote a few of the songs on Let Talk About Love (1997) and These Are Special Times (1998). She is often the subject of media ridicule and parody and is frequently impersonated on shows such as MADtv, Saturday Night Live, South Park, Royal Canadian Air Farce, and This Hour Has 22 Minutes for her strong accent and onstage gesticulations. However, she has stated that she is unaffected by the comments, and is flattered that people take the time to impersonate her. She even invited Ana Gasteyer, who parodied her on SNL, to appear onstage during one of her performances in New York City. While she is rarely politically outspoken, in 2005 following the Hurricane Katrina disaster, Dion appeared on Larry King Live and tearfully criticized the US government slow response in aiding the victims of the hurricane: \"There people still there waiting to be rescued. To me that is not acceptable ... How can it be so easy to send planes in another country to kill everybody in a second and destroy lives. We need to serve our country.\" After her interview, she stated, \"When I do interviews with Larry King or the big TV shows like that, they put you on the spot, which is very difficult. I do have an opinion, but Im a singer. Im not a politician.\"  Voice and timbre Dion once claimed herself to be a mezzo-soprano. However, attempts to adapt classical voice types to other forms of singing have been met with controversy. Kent Nagano, maestro of the Munich Symphony Orchestra, remarked, \"All you just sang was soprano\", after Dion auditioned with two solos from Carmen, wanting to know if she could sing opera. Her timbre has been described as \"thin, slightly nasal\" with a \"raspy\" lower register and \"bell glass-like high notes\". According to Linda Lister in Divafication: The Deification of Modern Female Pop Stars, she has been described as a reigning \"Queen of Pop\" for her influence over the recording industry during the 1990s, alongside other female artists, including Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. In a countdown of the \"22 Greatest Voices in Music\" by Blender Magazine and MTV, she placed ninth (sixth for a female), and she was also placed fourth in Cover Magazine list of \"The 100 Outstanding Pop Vocalists\". MTV Australia ranked Dion at fourth place in their list of Top 10 music divas of all time. Dion is often compared to Houston and Carey for her vocal style, and to her idol Barbra Streisand for her voice. She is often praised for her technical virtuosity. Jim Santella of The Buffalo News writes \"Like an iron fist in a velvet glove, the power of Celine Dion voice is cloaked in a silky vibrato that betrays the intensity of her vocal commitment.\" Jeff Miers, also of The Buffalo News, says of Dion \"Her singing voice is absolutely extra-human. She hits notes in full voice, with a controlled vibrato and an incredible conception of pitch, like she shucking an ear of corn.\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times states that Dion has \"a good-sized arsenal of technical skills. She can deliver tricky melismas, produce expressive vocal catches and sustain long notes without the tiniest wavering of pitch. And as her duets ... have shown, she is a reliable harmony voice.\" In an interview with Libération, Jean-Jacques Goldman notes that she has \"no problem of accuracy or tempo\". According to Kent Nagano, she is \"a musician who has a good ear, a refinement, and a degree of perfection that is enviable\". Charles Alexander of Time states, \"[Her] voice glides effortlessly from deep whispers to dead-on high notes, a sweet siren that combines force with grace.\" In her French repertoire, Dion adorns her vocals with more nuances and expressiveness, with the emotional intensity being \"more tender and intimate\". Additionally, Luc Plamondon, a French singer-songwriter who has worked closely with Dion claims that there are three chanteuses (stylistically) that she uses: the Québécois, the French, and the American. Her self-titled 1992 album was promoted with the slogan \"Remember the name because youll never forget the voice.\"  Legacy Dion is regarded as one of pop music most influential vocalists. She has been referred to as the \"Priestess of Pop\". Ed Christman from Billboard called Dion the \"Queen of Pop\". Her music and vocal styling, alongside that of Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, have been said to shape how the bulk of modern female pop vocalists sing. These three artists have been widely credited with reviving the power ballad, and in doing so reshaping the adult contemporary radio format, making it one of the most popular formats of the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2002, Billboard named her as the \"Best-selling contemporary female artist in history\". According to producer, musician, and former American Idol judge Randy Jackson, Dion, Houston, and Carey are the voices of the modern era. Music critic and Dion biographer Carl Wilson notes that her \"fame and influence is also renewed and expressed regularly these days by American Idol, the largest mass musical phenomenon of the past decade, where Celine stood solidly in its pantheon of singers for young people to emulate\". Many contestants on the countless televised talent competitions that have risen at the turn of the millennium often emulate Dion, Houston and Carey and cite them as idols. MTV also praised Dion by saying: \"Céline Dion was better than almost anyone at capitalizing on pop ability to articulate feelings in sensational, over-the-top ways.\" Numerous artists have either mentioned Dion as a major influence or as one of their favourite singers including: Britney Spears, Rihanna, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato, Adele, Rachelle Ann Go, Josh Groban, Delta Goodrem, Leona Lewis, Jennifer Hudson, Vanessa Hudgens, Kelly Clarkson,  Perrie Edwards, Loren Allred, Brazilian singer Wanessa Camargo, Ariana Grande, Sam Smith, Frank Ocean, Ava Max, Charlotte Cardin, and V among many others. Country singer Martina McBride is widely heralded by the press as the Celine Dion of Country music. Many artists have also praised Dion voice, singing ability or expressed an interest in working with her including Met Opera conductor and musical director Yannick Nézet-Séguin, Beyoncé, Carlos Santana, Elton John, OneRepublic, Coldplay, Sharon Osbourne, Nicole Scherzinger, Ne-Yo, Carole King, Barbra Streisand, Luciano Pavarotti, Bee Gees, Sir George Martin, Justin Bieber, Jean-Jacques Goldman, Drake and Cher. Timbaland stated \"Celine has such a beautiful, mesmerizing voice. She is so talented. I think we could create something that is a classic like she is already.\" Josh Groban remarked \"She a powerhouse. In this day and age, when more and more studio-produced, tiny-tiny voices are being rewarded ... she has this extraordinary instrument.\" According to Diane Warren, \"Celine is the best singer by far of her generation\", an opinion shared by Quincy Jones, Tommy Mottola, and David Foster. Moreover, Shania Twain and Jennifer Lopez have praised her dynamic stage presence, with Jennifer Lopez commenting on American Idol: \"Celine gets on stage, she owns the stage, she runs all over that stage, she stops that stage.\" Leona Lewis is also a huge fan of Céline Dion saying \"Celine is someone I aspire to be like in every way. \"Gosh – I cant wait. Im in the middle of picking out dresses at the moment. Celine is definitely one of my heroes. She is amazing.\" American singer and actress Lea Michele said that she listened to Dion music while in the process of making her sophomore album Places and cited her as one of her vocal influences. Godmother of Soul Patti LaBelle called Dion as one of the greatest singers ever. Pop singer Kelly Clarkson also praised Dion vocal ability saying: \"she has two sets of lungs when she sings\", and also called her the most gifted vocalist on the planet. Dion holds the Guinness World Record for the most Juno Awards won for Album Of The Year (tied with Michael Bublé and Arcade Fire). She won 3 out of the 13 nominations she received in the category throughout her career. Dion is the third most decorated artist in Juno Awards history, winning 20 out of the 75 total nominations ever, becoming the most nominated artist in the awards history as well. In January 2023, CNN reported that her exclusion from Rolling Stone list of the 200 greatest singers of all time sparked outrage.  Cultural impact Francophone music industry On a cultural level, Dion is credited for introducing francophone music to many non-francophone countries around the globe. Her albums Deux and Sil suffisait daimer remain the best selling francophone albums in history, gaining unprecedented success in non-Francophone markets such as the United Kingdom, Poland, Netherlands, Portugal, Greece, Austria, Japan, and New Zealand. According to RFI Musique, she \"has done her bit for French music over the years, assuring the success of French songs which would probably never have got beyond Francophone borders without her ... Without Celine, French record sales would be dramatically lower!\" In May 2008, she was awarded France highest award, as Knight of the Legion of Honour by President of France Nicolas Sarkozy. Sarkozy praised Dion and stated: \"France thanks you because your talent and success have contributed to the influence of the French language outside our borders\".  Las Vegas strip She is also credited for both revitalizing and revolutionizing the entertainment scene in Las Vegas with the gargantuan successes of her residencies there. She signed a $100 million contract for a residency in Vegas, which is considered one of the most lucrative and risky residency contracts in the touring industry. Billboard credits Dion as the one who pioneered modern Las Vegas residencies, saying: \"Since Dion debut, hundreds of artists have tried their hand at Vegas residencies ... Once considered the domain of artists long past their peak, today Las Vegas residency shows are big business, generating millions in sales.\" Dion is popularly referred as the reigning \"Queen of Las Vegas\" by various media outlets for her impact and legacy in the city. According to Gary Bongiovanni, president and editor-in-chief of Pollstar, \"Celine redefined what artists can do in Las Vegas, helping to make it arguably the busiest entertainment city in the world.\" Kurt Melien, vice-president of entertainment at Caesar Palace, stated \"Celine was a pioneer without question. Twenty years ago, we couldnt have got someone the stature of Britney Spears to appear in Vegas. Stars like her would never have considered it if Celine hadnt paved the way. She changed the face of modern Vegas.\" The Guardian listed Dion Vegas residency as one of \"50 gigs that changed music\", saying: \"it was Céline Dion who turned Caesars into the stage for a glorious pop comeback. Her initial five-year run was followed by a further eight years – and prompted copycat turns by Britney Spears, Pink and Katy Perry.  Economy Regarding her financial impact on Las Vegas, Stephen Brown, director of the Centre for Business and Economic Research in Las Vegas, commented: \"People will come to the city just for her and they will spend money and as a consequence, she has an outsized impact on the economy\", then adding \"Bigger than Elvis, Sinatra and Liberace put together? Definitely.\" Estimations indicate that Dion show will create up to 7,000 indirect jobs and around $114 million worth of new economic activity in each of the three years for which she has been contracted.  Business Forbes also discussed how entrepreneurs can reclaim the power in their business by being like Céline Dion as an example saying: \"Well, remember back in 2017 when Dion launched her handbag line? During a press conference, she admitted her late manager (and husband) had always handled everything for her. Every aspect of her shows was pre-decided; every move, appearance and interview was programmed in advance. She just showed up and executed (which she did brilliantly). At the end of her handbag launch press release, she said \"Now ... Im the boss.\" Starting right then and there, shed be the one calling the shots for her shows, her kids, her handbags and everything else that mattered to her. She was going to do things her way.\"  Fashion Celine Dion has received various acclaims from fashion critics for reinventing her fashion style over the years. The Guardian called her \"The Joyous New Queen of Fashion\". Harper Bazaar also praised Dion for being an ultimate fashion risk-taker and called her a \"Fashion Chameleon\". Billboard dubbed her as \"Streetwear Icon\" after recapping the global icon style evolution through the years. Vogue named her as one of music most exuberant dressers, beloved as much for her glorious voice as her extravagant sense of style. Tatler discussed in an article how Cardi B might be the next Céline Dion of Paris Fashion Week, proving that Céline is the standard for the occasion. Fashion stylist and image architect Law Roach praised Celine Dion, calling her \"The Queen of Camp\" and \"The Queen of Glitter & Sequins\". Dion further cemented her name in the fashion world by wearing the reverse tuxedo at 1999 Academy Awards, which became one of the most talked ensembles of that time. Vogue also listed her iconic 1999 reverse tuxedo as one of the most controversial looks of all time saying it was undeniably the highlight of the year. W also listed the iconic ensemble as one of the most memorable dresses of all time. In February 2020, Sergio Guadarrama, a contestant of Project Runway, copied the idea of reverse tuxedo and claimed it was his original idea and had even claimed that he had no idea about the iconic tuxedo, which left the fans of the show disappointed.  Global impact Vice discussed how Dion music made impact in Nigerian culture, saying: \"By the 2000s, Celine Dion was basically the queen of Nigerian airwaves. It was impossible to watch TV or listen to the radio without hearing her music – either on adverts, or in Nollywood films featuring heartthrobs like Genevieve Nnaji and Ramsey Nouah.\" Billboard also discussed how Dion appearance at Jamaica Jazz & Blues changed the festival future. According to Walter Elmore, CEO of Art of Music Productions said Dion is by far the most expensive artist he has ever booked, further saying: \"I have already received calls from the management of several major US artists who want to perform here next year because they heard Celine comments about our show production quality,\" Elmore said. \"Her performance confirms that we can bring the biggest artists on the planet to our little island.\" In 2012, Dion visited Jamaica for the first time which broke attendance records and caused traffic congestion around the concert venue. Vice discussed how Dion music has been constant in dancehall clubs for decades, as many Jamaican dancehall artists cover her songs and remixing her ballads into anthems of dance hall. Further adding: \"Several current dancehall musicians continue to use utilize Dion tunes with the addition of upbeat guitars, pan flutes, and backbeat shuffles that transform the music for consumption by dancehall fans.\"  Reference in other music The Canadian comedy music group the Arrogant Worms released an album, Dirt, in 1999 which contained a song, \"Celine Dion\", about Dion stalker-like affection for her. Dion has also been referred to in various hit songs including \"Dark Fantasy\" by Kanye West, \"911/Mr. Lonely\" by Tyler, the Creator, \"That Girl\" by Pharrell Williams, \"Work\" by A$AP Ferg, and \"What The Use\" by Mac Miller, to name a few. Jazz vocalist Ranee Lee released an album titled \"Because You Loved Me,\" covering some of Dion biggest songs. Lee praised Dion stating: \"I love Céline as a vocal musician, she fantastic. There no one who can surpass her ability and range these days\"  Cultural honors In 1999, Dion received a star on Canada Walk of Fame and was inducted into the Canadian Broadcast Hall of Fame. She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in January 2004, one which she dedicated to her father, who had died the month prior. In May 2003, she placed at No. 10 on VH1 list of \"50 Greatest Women of the Video Era\". Dion album Falling into You is included on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Definitive 200 list. \"My Heart Will Go On\" was included in the list of Songs of the Century, by the Recording Industry Association of America and the National Endowment for the Arts.

In 2004, she was awarded the Society of Singers Lifetime Achievement Award. On 26 July 2013, she was awarded the highest rank of the Order of Canada, the Companion of the Order of Canada, by the Governor General of Canada and the investiture ceremony was held at Citadelle of Quebec, in which they said: \"An incomparable artist, she is equally known for her compassion, generosity and commitment to a number of social and humanitarian causes. She is notably the national celebrity patron for Cystic Fibrosis Canada and honorary patron of the CHU Sainte-Justine. In addition, through her foundation, she also helps children in need and their families here in Canada and abroad.\" By the end of 1998, Dion was recognized by Billboard as the \"Woman of the Year\". They also stated how Céline voice was featured in eight charting albums on Billboard 200 year-end chart which sold 18 million units during a calendar year (excluding her own catalog sales and recent releases at that time). West University of Timișoara conducted a research study that analyzes Céline Dion contributions to global music culture in both spatial and temporal terms, In November 2013, Dion was inducted at the American Gaming Association Hall Of Fame for her outstanding contributions to the growth and stature of the gaming industry.  In popular culture Dion was referenced as an antagonist character named \"Feline Dion\" from the hit animated series Totally Spies!, which was aired in an episode in 2013. A cardboard cutout of Dion was also featured on the 7th episode of the animated series Total Drama Island. In 2022, Dion was also referenced in the animated fantasy film Turning Red. She was cast as a villain in Angloman, a 1995 satirical comic by Mark Shainblum and Gabriel Morrissette. In 2021, French actress and filmmaker Valérie Lemercier released Aline, a film which fictionalized Dion life with Lemercier playing a singer named \"Aline Dieu\".  Commercial impact In 1997–1998, Dion sold more than 60 million albums, and was estimated to sell a record once every 1.2 seconds. Dion is also recognized as the world top-selling artist of the 90s decade. In 2017, Dion broke records across the UK as the highest grossing artist at each UK venue where she performed including dates at London O2 Arena, Leeds First Direct Arena, Birmingham Barclaycard Arena and Glasgow SSE Hydro. John Meglen, president and co-CEO, Concerts West commended her by saying: \"She really is the voice of our lifetime.\" In 2018, there were over 300,000 Taiwanese fans that clambered for the 20,000 tickets available for Célines first concert ever in Taiwan which caused the system to lag for 30 minutes. The demand caused them to add two additional shows eventually.  Other activities Business endeavours Les Productions Feeling Inc., also known as Feeling Inc. or just Feeling, is an artist management company based in Laval, Québec, Canada, and owned by Dion and her husband and manager, Rene Angélil. She is also founder of Nickels Restaurant food chain. She and her husband also own Le Mirage Golf Club and Schwartz Restaurant. In association with Andre Agassi, Steffi Graf and Shaquille ONeal, she opened a popular night club called Pure, located at Caesars Palace. Dion launched an eponymous bag and accessories line \"Céline Dion Collection\". According to Innee-Sedona International, the Asia partner for Bugatti Group said that it already topped $10 million sales after just three collections. Dion became an entrepreneur with the establishment of her franchise restaurant Nickels in 1990. She has since divested her interests in the chain and is no longer affiliated with Nickels, as of 1997. In 2003, Dion signed a deal with Coty to release Celine Dion Parfums. Her latest fragrance, Signature, was released in September 2011 with an advertising campaign by New York agency Kraftworks NYC. Since its inception, Celine Dion Parfums has grossed over $850 million in retail sales. In October 2004, Air Canada hired Dion as part of their promotional campaign to unveil new service products and an updated livery. \"You and I\", the theme song sung by Dion, was written by advertising executives working for Air Canada.  Philanthropy Dion has actively supported many charity organizations, worldwide. She has promoted the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CCFF) since 1982, and became the foundation National Celebrity Patron in 1993. She has an emotional attachment to the foundation; her niece Karine died from the disease at the age of sixteen, in Dion arms. In 2003, she joined a number of other celebrities, athletes, and politicians, including Josh Groban and Yolanda Adams, to support \"World Children Day\", a global fundraising effort sponsored by McDonald. The effort raised money from more than 100 nations and benefited orphanages and children health organizations. In addition, she has been a major supporter of the T. J. Martell Foundation, the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Fund, and many health and educational campaigns. During the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, she donated $1 million to the victims of the storm, and held a fund-raising event for the victims of the 2004 Asian tsunami, which subsequently raised more than $1 million. After the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, she donated $100,000 to China Children & Teenagers Fund and sent a letter showing her consolation and support. Since 2004, she is involved, alongside husband René Angelil, with the Québec gay community by supporting the publication of health and HIV prevention materials in Gay Globe Magazine, owned by journalist Roger-Luc Chayer. She is also a member of Canadian charity Artists Against Racism. In November 2018, she launched a gender-neutral clothing line for kids, Celinununu. In 2009, Dion joined an effort along with Leonardo DiCaprio, James Cameron and Kate Winslet, to donate money to support the nursing home fees of the then-last living survivor of the sinking of the Titanic, Millvina Dean. The campaign resulted in $30,000 as donation.  Personal life As the youngest of 14 children, Dion grew up wearing hand-me-downs and sharing a bed with several sisters. As a baby, she slept in a drawer to save on a crib. She was bullied at school and called \"Vampire\", owing to her teeth and skinny frame. Local tabloids even dubbed her \"Canine Dion\" in the teenage years of her career. She often spoke of running home from school to play music in the basement with her brothers and sisters. \"I detested school\", she would later write in her autobiography. \"I had always lived surrounded by adults and children a lot older than me. I learned everything I needed to know from them. As far as I was concerned, real life existed around them.\" Dion eldest sister was already in her twenties, married, and pregnant with her first child at the time Dion mother, Thérèse, was pregnant with Celine. Dion first met René Angélil, her future husband and manager, in 1980, when she was 12 and he was 38, after her brother, Michel Dondalinger Dion, had sent him a demonstration recording of \"Ce nétait quun rêve\" (\"It Was Only a Dream/Nothing but a Dream\"), a song she, her mother Thérèse, and her brother Jacques Dion had jointly written. Over subsequent years, Angélil guided her to stardom in francophone territories. After the dissolution (around 1985) of Angélil second marriage, he and Dion took a break from each other professionally, and he spent the major part of the year in Las Vegas, while Dion was learning English and taking dance and vocal lessons in Montreal. Upon his return, \"he avoided being alone with me for too long a time\", she said in her 2000 autobiography My Story, My Dream. Meanwhile, she kept a photo of Angélil under her pillow, later writing, \"Before I fell asleep, I slipped it under the pillow, out of fear that my mother, who always shared a room with me, would find it.\" She also wrote \"Less and less could I hide from myself the fact that I was in love with René; I had all the symptoms,\" and \"I was in love with a man I couldnt love, who didnt want me to love him, who didnt want to love me.\" Dion mother, who traveled everywhere with her until she was 19, was initially wary of her growing infatuation with a much older and twice-divorced Angélil, but Dion was insistent, telling her mother \"Im not a minor. This is a free country. No one has the right to prevent me from loving whoever I want to.\" Their professional relationship eventually turned romantic after Dion win at the Eurovision Song Contest in Dublin in 1988; she was 20. The romance was known to only family and friends for five years, though Dion nearly revealed all in a tearful 1992 interview with journalist Lise Payette. Many years later, Payette penned the song \"Je cherche lombre\" for Dion 2007 album Delles. Dion and Angélil became engaged on 30 March 1993, which was Dion 25th birthday, and made their relationship public in the liner notes of her 1993 album The Colour of My Love. They married on 17 December 1994, at Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal, Quebec. On 5 January 2000, Dion and Angélil renewed their wedding vows in Las Vegas. In May 2000, Dion had two small operations at a fertility clinic in New York to improve her chances of conceiving, after deciding to use in vitro fertilization because of years of failed attempts to conceive. Their first son, René-Charles Angélil, was born on 25 January 2001. Dion suffered a miscarriage in 2009. In May 2010, Angélil announced that she was 14 weeks pregnant with twins after a sixth treatment of in vitro fertilization. On Saturday, 23 October 2010, at 11:11 and 11:12 am respectively, Dion gave birth to fraternal twins by Caesarean section at St. Mary Medical Center in West Palm Beach, Florida, The twins were named Eddy, after Dion favourite French songwriter, Eddy Marnay, who had also produced her first five albums; and Nelson, after former South African President Nelson Mandela. She appeared with her newborn sons on the cover of 9 December 2010 issue of the Canadian edition of Hello! magazine.  On 14 January 2016, Angélil died at age 73 of throat cancer. His funeral was held on 22 January 2016, in Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal, where he and Dion wed 21 years earlier. The couple eldest son René-Charles gave the eulogy, three days before his 15th birthday. Following Angélil death, Dion became the sole owner and president of her management and production companies, including CDA Productions and Les Productions Feeling. Two days after Angélil death—on what would have been her husband birthday—one of Dion brothers, Daniel, died at age 59, also of cancer. On 22 March 2018, Dion management team announced that she had been dealing with hearing irregularities for the previous 12–18 months due to patulous Eustachian tube and would undergo a minimally invasive surgical procedure to correct the problem after ear-drop medications appeared to be no longer working. Owing to her slight frame, Dion has for decades been subject of eating disorder rumors, which she has consistently denied: \"I dont have an eating problem, and there nothing more I can say about it\". \"My work requires me to be in great physical shape. I wouldnt have been able to give up to a hundred shows a year and travel ceaselessly from one end of the world to the other if I had eaten too much or not enough, or if, as certain magazines have claimed, I made myself throw up after each meal.\" She has often spoken about having been bullied at school and lacking confidence in her early years in the business: \"I didnt have, visually, what it took. I was not pretty, I had teeth problems, and I was very skinny. I didnt fit the mold\". Dion took up ballet under the guidance of her former dancer, Naomi Stikeman, who also previously performed for The National Ballet of Canada and La La La Human Steps, and former Cirque du Soleil dancer-turned-fashion-illustrator, Pepe Muñoz, who is also part of her styling team. She is also a skier and a regular at her son René-Charles hockey games.  Dion resides in Henderson, Nevada, in a house she bought with her husband in 2003. She previously owned homes in Montreal, Quebec, and Jupiter Island, Florida. Dion older son René-Charles Angélil loves music and has tried to follow a musical path. Under the stage name Big Tip, he released six rap songs on his SoundCloud account in May 2018 including originals \"The Kid\", \"The Apple\" and \"Never Stop\" and two adaptations from The Weeknd songs, \"Catwalks\" sampling on The Weeknd \"Sidewalks\" and a remix of The Weeknd \"Loft Music\" as \"Loft Music Remix\". He also released the 5-track EP CasiNo. 5 in December 2020 using the artistic name RC Angelil. The EP includes the tracks \"Mamba Mentality\", \"Money, Thrills and Rest\", \"No Ls\", \"GG4\" (featuring PAKKA) and \"LV\". In December 2022, Dion disclosed that she had been diagnosed with stiff-person syndrome, a neurological disorder affecting her muscles.  In June 2024, Dion publicly disclosed in a People magazine cover story that she had struggled with a variety of mysterious symptoms for 17 years before her August 2022 diagnosis.  It was also concurrently revealed that for two years, Dion had been under the care of Dr. Amanda Piquet, a specialist in autoimmune neurology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colorado, and that Dion charitable foundation was donating $2 million to the Anschutz Medical Campus to support autoimmune neurology research for five years.

He is credited with popularizing hip hop in Middle America and is regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time. His global success is considered to have broken racial barriers to the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him a controversial figure, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as influencing many musical artists. His most popular songs include \"My Name Is\", \"The Real Slim Shady\", \"Stan\", \"Without Me\", \"Till I Collapse\", \"Lose Yourself\", \"Not Afraid\", \"Love the Way You Lie\", \"The Monster\" and \"Houdini\".\nAfter the release of his debut album Infinite (1996) and the extended play Slim Shady EP (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP. His next two releases, The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and The Eminem Show (2002), were worldwide successes and were nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, the latter becoming the best-selling album worldwide of 2002. After the release of his next album, Encore (2004), Eminem went on hiatus, largely due to a prescription drug addiction. He returned to the music industry with the releases of Relapse (2009) and Recovery (2010), the latter becoming the best-selling album worldwide of 2010. He then released the US number-one albums The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013), Revival (2017), Kamikaze (2018), and Music to Be Murdered By (2020). His twelfth studio album, The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce), was released in July 2024.\nEminem was also a member of the hip hop group D12, and has collaborated with fellow Detroit-based rapper Royce da 5'9\" as the duo Bad Meets Evil. Eminem played a dramatized version of himself in the 2002 musical drama film 8 Mile. \"Lose Yourself\", a song from its soundtrack, topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 12 weeks—the most for a solo rap song—and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, making him the first hip hop artist ever to win the award. He also co-founded Shady Records, which helped launch the careers of artists such as D12, 50 Cent, and Obie Trice, and established his own Sirius XM Radio channel, Shade 45.\nEminem is among the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated worldwide sales of over 220 million records. He was the best-selling music artist in the United States for the 2000s, placing third for the 2010s. He was the first artist to have ten albums consecutively debut at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, and has had five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Curtain Call: The Hits (2005), \"Lose Yourself\", \"Love the Way You Lie\", and \"Not Afraid\" have all been certified Diamond or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). He has won numerous awards, including 15 Grammy Awards, eight American Music Awards, 17 Billboard Music Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, and an MTV Europe Music Global Icon Award. Billboard named him the \"Artist of the Decade (2000–2009)\", and Rolling Stone named him one of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\" and \"100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time\". In 2022, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>"
